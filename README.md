# JSON to Markdown Files

Hack a massive SharePoint 2013 list of articles into individual Markdown files with appropriate YAML front-matter.

## Overview

This project was created to get a SharePoint list, of over 2,400 articles, out of the old CMS. To get the RSS feed as JSON, I used an online rss-to-json converter (<https://rsstojson.com>.)

The JavaScript in `index.js` consumes a JavaScript object and outputs markdown files. The articles are represented as an array of objects where each object is an articleâ€”each object has keys and values that makeup the article content.

It uses a simple for-loop to iterate over each article, generate the YAML front-matter and content, and then use the Nodejs built-in filesystem (`const fs = require('fs')`) to write/name the file:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

fs.writeFile(filename, fileString, (err) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log('The file has been saved!');
});
```
- The `filename` variable passed to `fs.writeFile()` and should include the extension - I use the article title to create unique filenames.
  - If you want to write the files to a specific folder, make sure the directory exists first.
- `fileString` becomes the contents of the file and must be a string
- The anonymous callback function that throws an error and logs the console message is required because it is unsafe to run `fs.writeFile()` multiple times without waiting for the callback.

## Prerequisites

- Nodejs
- An RSS feed to convert into JSON

## Installation
