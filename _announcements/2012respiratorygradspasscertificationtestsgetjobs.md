<div>All December 2012 graduates of the Respiratory Therapist program at KCC have passed the National Board for Respiratory Care examination to become Registered Respiratory Therapists.<br /> <br />“All 2012 graduates passed all three of the National Board exams on their first attempt by March of 2013,” said Nancy Ozee, director and professor for the KCC Respiratory Therapist Program. “While 100 percent of KCC graduates passed the exams, the nationwide pass rate is only 65 percent.”<br /> <br />All of the 2012 KCC graduates are employed in the field of respiratory therapy, Ozee said.<br /> <br />To become a Registered Respiratory Therapist, candidates must pass three National Board exams totaling 9 hours. Although KCC’s graduates passed all three exams, to be a licensed respiratory therapist in Illinois only requires passing the initial exam, called the entry level exam.<br /> <br />KCC offers an associate degree in respiratory therapist which prepares graduates as competent advanced-level respiratory therapists able to care for and treat patients suffering from breathing disorders. Graduates also may work in fields related to diagnostic testing or clinical supervision.<br /> <br />The two-year program includes theory and clinical practice. It is accredited by the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs through recommendation of the Joint Review Committee for Respiratory Therapy Education.<br /> <br />Twenty students can be admitted into the program each spring semester. Applications for 2015 entry are currently available. For application criteria or other information, call Ozee at 815-802-8842, email <a href="mailto:nozee@kcc.edu">nozee@kcc.edu</a>, or call the KCC Student Services Department at 815-802-8500.<br /> <br />In the photo, members of the KCC Respiratory Therapist class of 2012 (left to right), Christy Schriefer of Bourbonnais, Rollin Marr of Manteno, and Ashley Prairie of Clifton at Brickstone Restaurant &amp; Brewery in Bourbonnais. They were attending an event with the program’s advisory committee celebrating that the graduates all successfully completed three National Board Exams on the first attempt.<br /></div>
