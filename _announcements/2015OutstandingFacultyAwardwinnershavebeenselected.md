<p>Please join the Faculty Growth and Development committee in congratulating two of our faculty who have been selected for the 2015 KCC Outstanding Faculty Member Awards.</p>
<p>The full-time faculty reciepient is <strong>Mary Steichen</strong>, professor of speech communications in the Humanities and Social Sciences Division.</p>
<p>Mary incorporates a number of innovative teaching strategies into her classroom. Feedback from her students is consistently positive and appreciative. Many cite Mary’s unique ability to provide a safe and comfortable environment for delivering speeches. She connects with students and makes it a priority to know each personally. Outside the classroom, Mary is the chair of the Faculty Growth and Development Committee. She leads and coordinates in-service events and also demonstrates a spirit of collegiality by presenting on teaching and learning topics. She’s also been a champion for assessment efforts at KCC, having participated since early pilots and presenting numerous times.</p>
<p>There also is an <a href="/Documents/SteichenInfographic2015.pdf">infographic</a> which supports Mary’s nomination for the statewide award.</p>
<p>The Outstanding Part-Time Faculty Member Award recipient from KCC is <strong>Ron Shank</strong>, who teaches subjects including sociology and first year college experience in the Humanities and Social Sciences Division.</p>
<p>Ron has worked in education for 40 years. He embodies the characteristics that mark a passionate and sincere educator. In eight years at KCC, he has demonstrated more than just excellence in teaching; he’s a mentor to both students and faculty. He is typically among the first to happily provide assistance when called upon. Ron also has volunteered his time and served tirelessly to become a well-respected leader of the KCC Adjunct Association. Under his leadership, the association has worked to resolve many issues and build a positive working relationship with the administration. Ron’s efforts both inside and outside of the classroom demonstrate his commitment to student success and education.</p>
<p>Mary and Ron will be KCC's nominees for the annual Illinois Community College Trustees Association outstanding faculty awards presented in June.</p>
<p>In all, 44 full-time faculty and 14 adjunct faculty were nominated by students and colleagues for their excellence in teaching.<br /></p>
