<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassA57AA4F88B774AB483BFD2ECB3BA2AB1"><div><font size="2">From: the Faculty Development Committee</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />Annually, the Illinois Community College Trustees Association presents a number of awards to students, graduates, trustees and faculty members. </div>
<div><br />Two KCC faculty are among this year’s nominees, Kris Condon in the Outstanding Full-Time Faculty Member Award category, and Dana Meyer in the Outstanding Part-Time Faculty Member category. </div>
<div><br />To see the full nominations for Kris and Dana, go to the <a href="/FacultyStaff/departments/ktlc/Pages/tlc-calendar.aspx">Teaching &amp; Learning Center Special Events</a> page</font><font size="2">.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />Along with other nominees from around the state, they will be recognized at the ICCTA annual meeting and awards ceremony on June 3 in Bloomington.</div>
<div><br />Congratulations to Kris and Dana on their nominations!</div>
<div><br /><font color="#0000ff">Kris Condon<br /></font>Kris is a professor for the Business/Technology Division and Continuing Education and Career Services. She has worked at KCC since August 1998.</div>
<div><br />“What makes Kris a terrific educator is the degree of care, presentation and thoughtfulness she gives to every lesson,” said Mary Posing, director of Continuing Education and Career Services. “Each class Kris teaches is crafted to perfection regardless of whether it’s for a corporate client, community member, college student or employee.”</div>
<div><br />She is the only instructor at KCC to hold the Microsoft Office Master Instructor certification.</div>
<div><br />Following establishment of the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program, which she coordinated, Kris then led the effort to earn American Bar Association approval for it, and the program earned ABA initial approval 33 months after first offering classes. The average initial approval is 60-72 months after program implementation. </div>
<div><br />Another noteworthy event for the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program happened in the fall of 2010. In September, KCC was invited to be the first college in recorded Illinois Appellate Court history to host proceedings—not a mock trial. The event came after a partnership between the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program and Illinois Supreme Court Chief Justice Thomas Kilbride’s Judicial Education Program.</div>
<div><br />Kris also has been involved with the Career Services “boot camp,” designing and presenting workshops for students and the community on cover letter and resume writing, interviewing, and attending a job fair.</div>

<div><font size="2"><font color="#0000ff">Dana Meyer<br /></font>Since 2003, Dana has taught courses for the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />A partner in the Kankakee law firm of Ackman, Marek, Meyer, Tebo and Coghlan Ltd., Dana is the longest serving adjunct faculty member in the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program.</div>
<div><br />“As a practicing attorney in Kankakee, Ms. Meyer not only balances her own career but takes time to teach in the Paralegal program,” said Paul Carlson, chair of the Business/Technology Division. “Her dedication to her legal career, to serving the people of Kankakee as a volunteer and to the KCC paralegal program has been noteworthy.”</div>
<div><br />Dana is noted for having exceptional course evaluations from students. She also has worked to align the outcomes in the Civil Litigation course she developed with the outcomes in the companion Legal Research and Writing I course. One result of Dana’s efforts is that four-year schools with whom KCC has transfer agreements routinely state that KCC’s students arrive with a strong foundation.</div>
<div><br />In addition to teaching for the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program, Dana’s law firm has served as an internship site for students since 2004. <br />Dana is on the 2011-12 American Bar Association Reapproval Task Force. She also serves as a faculty representative on the Paralegal Advisory Committee.</font></div>
