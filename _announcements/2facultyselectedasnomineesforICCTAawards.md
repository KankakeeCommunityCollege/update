<div><font color="#000080">Submitted by Craig Keigher on behalf of the Faculty Growth and Development Committee</font> 
<div><br />Please join the Faculty Growth and Development committee in congratulating two of our faculty in their nominations for the 2014 ICCTA Outstanding Faculty Awards.</div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>The full-time faculty nominee is <strong>Cari Stevenson</strong>, professor of psychology in the Humanities and Social Sciences Division.</div>
<div><br />Cari embodies the qualities of a faculty member deserving of this award. Her focus on initiatives dealing with military veteran students sets her nomination apart. She has worked tirelessly in this area to gain a better understanding of how to better serve the unique needs of this population. From attending training at the Edward Hines, Jr. VA Hospital to providing training to faculty on how to help military veteran students succeed, Cari truly has a mission of helping these students. When her plans of opening a Veterans Center at KCC have been realized, the college will be able to better help military veterans transition back to civilian life. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cari’s efforts in this area demonstrate the exceptional leadership and compassion she displays in her professional life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>There also is a <a href="http://youtu.be/SzFj7LOfMsA">video which can be viewed on YouTube </a>which supports Cari's nomination.</div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>The Outstanding Part-Time Faculty Member Award nominee from KCC is <strong>Circuit Judge Gordon L. Lustfeldt</strong>, who also is the lead instructor in criminal litigation for the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program.</div>
<div><br />Lustfeldt works in the community’s justice system and brings real-world experience into his classroom. His focus on professional development is unrivalled. His most recent endeavors include leadership in offering a Search and Seizure seminar, presenting at the KCC Faculty In-Service and the Judicial Education Conference.</div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>We are proud to have both Cari and Judge Lustfeldt represent us as nominees for the annual faculty awards.
