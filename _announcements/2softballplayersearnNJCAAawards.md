<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC1B2B51807094BC18F76A98F23133DE3"><div>Two players on the national championship team from Kankakee Community College have been recognized by the NJCAA for athletic and achievements.<br /><br /><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Plimmer_update.jpg" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />Brittany Plimmer of Bloomingdale and Stephanie Sanderson of Homer have both received the NJCAA Award for Exemplary Academic Achievement for earning grade point averages of 3.60 or higher on a 4.0 scale for 45 semester hours. The awards were formerly called “Academic All-American.”<br /><br />Plimmer received three additional awards for her performance on the field. Both the NJCAA and the NFCA (National Fastpitch Coaches Association) named her a first-team All-American. She also earned the NJCAA Marucci Elite Hitter award for Region 4, Division II. <br /><br />For the Cavaliers, Plimmer was the catcher and played in all 51 games during her sophomore season. She batted .512, a team record for a single season. Plimmer finished in the top 10 in the nation in six categories, including runs scored (67), total bases (160) and slugging percentage (.988). Plimmer hit 16 home runs (10th in the nation), including a solo shot in the national championship game. She was ranked 4th in the nation in doubles, with 25. Plimmer was no. 1 in the nation in fielding, holding a perfect 1.0 rating and committing no errors. She has now graduated from KCC with an Associate in Arts transfer degree. She will transfer with a softball scholarship to St. Xavier University in Chicago. <br /><br />“As I’ve said many times, Brittany is the best overall catcher I’ve coached in 36 years,” said Dennis Clark, the team’s head coach. “Brittany always led the team by example. Not only does she play the game the way it is supposed to be played, she also excels in the classroom. ” </div>
<div><br /><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/10%20Sanderson_update.jpg" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />The team’s left fielder, Sanderson made a big contribution with a three-run homer in the national championship game. She had 8 home runs for the season and finished with a .379 batting average. Sanderson has now graduated from KCC with an Associate in Arts transfer degree. She will transfer to Illinois State University. <br /><br />“Steph has contributed to our success both offensively and defensively in her two years at KCC,” Clark said. “She’s a great athlete who works as hard in the classroom as she does on the softball field.”<br /><br />Including Plimmer and Sanderson, KCC has had 18 softball players receive national academic awards. In 2015, the team won the NJCAA Division II national championship and finished the season with a 45-6 record. The Cavaliers softball team has qualified for the national tournament for 17 consecutive years.<br /><br />Additional information about KCC athletics is at <a href="http://www.kcccavaliers.com/">www.KCCCavaliers.com/</a>.</div>
