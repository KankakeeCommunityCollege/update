<p>Full-time employees, current adjunct instructors, and part-time employees averaging 16 hours or more of work per week have received an invitation to complete an employee satisfaction survey. </p></div>
<div>Following the first week the survey has been available,  almost 100 surveys have been completed. That is 22 percent of the 427 who have been invited to participate. Our goal is for at least 225 employees to complete the survey.</div>
<div><br />The survey should take about 20 minutes to complete. Noel Levitz is administering the survey and--as a third-party--helps assure that answers will be confidential. Information pertaining to individual identities will not be shared.</div>
<div><br />The survey will be available until 5 p.m. Friday, Feb 22.</div>
<div><br />This is the fifth year we have used Noel Levitz to administer the survey. It allows for comparison between years to see how we are doing, as well as a comparison to approximately 30 other community colleges across the nation. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We hope to have the survey results compiled and distributed in April.</div>
<div><br />Here is further information related to the survey, in the form of a Q &amp; A:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Q:</strong> Can the survey be saved and restarted if I am interrupted? </div>
<div><strong>A:</strong> Yes, as long as you use the same computer when returning to the survey.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Q:</strong> Can a computer lab be available so I won’t be interrupted when completing the survey? </div>
<div><strong>A:</strong> Yes, Room L165 in the Learning Resource Center will be available most days. Phone <span style="white-space:nowrap" class="baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1">815-802-8124</span> for times when Room L165 is available.</div>
<div><br /><strong>Q:</strong> Can the questions be available so employees can think about their responses before actually taking it? </div>
<div><strong>A: </strong>Yes, a PDF of last year’s survey (it has the same questions), <a href="/FacultyStaff/departments/hr/Documents/NL-Emp-Satisfaction-Survey.pdf">is attached</a>.  </div>
<div><br />As always, thank you for your cooperation and honest/constructive feedback.</div>
