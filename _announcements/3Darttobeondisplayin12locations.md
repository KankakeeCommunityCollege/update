<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1B361D942AD34EE685131F4C36DA74CD"><p><img alt="2015ARTMap.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/2015ARTMap.jpg" style="margin:5px" /><br /><br />On April 30, students will have 3-D art projects on display at 12 locations in and near the Riverfront Campus buildings.</p>
<p>Employees are welcome to use the accompanying map to walk around and look at the projects. Maps also will be available at the first floor reception desk.</p>
<p>The artwork will be in buildings and outside. The installations will be ready for viewing on April 30 from 10 a.m. - 8 p.m., which coincides with the <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Lists/Announcements/DispForm2.aspx?List=7e45450e-520d-4ad3-81dd-a79ebcc75df4&amp;ID=1889&amp;Source=http%3a//www.kcc.edu/FacultyStaff/update/Pages/dailyupdate.aspx&amp;Web=6dd7d01a-f4b3-47f9-8d35-b60692caa2f7">KCC Student Art Show</a> Closing Reception. </p>
<p>It is an interactive display. Two installations -- &quot;Framed&quot; &amp; &quot;Self Expression&quot; -- invite the viewers to participate by taking a &quot;selfie&quot; within the work and  and share it on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>As a requirement of the project, students will restore their installation site to the exact same condition it was in before the display. </p>
<p>The exhibit is coordinated by Margie Sula, who teaches the Three-dimensional art course.<br /> <br />***<br /> <br /><a href="/update">Go to Online Update</a><br /> </p></div></div>
