<p><img alt="Art map" src="/SiteCollectionImages/ArtMap-compressed.jpg" /> On May 1 and 2, students have 3-D art projects on display at 19 locations in and near the main college buildings.</p>
<p>Employees are welcome to use the accompanying map to walk around and look at the projects.</p>
<p>The artwork will be in buildings and outside. Students will be installing it on May 1 and 2 (Most art should be on display by noon May 2). It will remain in place until the end of the day May 2. All art should be &quot;off display&quot; by the end of the day May 3. </p>
<p>As a requirement of the project, students will restore their installation site to the exact same condition it was in before the display. </p>
<p>&quot;The participating students are excited and looking forward to creating these exhibits, and I invite everyone in the community to come and enjoy their efforts,&quot; said Margie Sula, who teaches the Three-dimensional art course.</p>
