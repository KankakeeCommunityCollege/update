<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass7D7460CFFF9F434195F90CCAF993681E><div>Forty-six welders tested their skills in a welding competition Saturday, April 21 at KCC.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The fourth annual Welding Rodeo had five events and was open to welders of all levels. Overall winner was Tim Dircks of Minooka, who won two events and placed second in another. His prize package included a KCC course.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Mr. Dircks graciously gave his classes back to the program and they were raffled off to two very appreciative KCC students,” said Mark Stevenson, coordinator of the KCC welding program. “Pratt Welding Supply also raffled off several prizes after the event, including two full tool sets and two auto-darkening welding hoods, welding jackets, gloves and safety glasses.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“We had competitors from KCC, Moraine Valley Community College, Joliet Junior College, and Pipefitters local 597 in the competition. It was our best turnout. There were twice as many participants as last year.” </div>

<div>Winner of the second event, a combination weldment, in the flat position, derived from a print provided that day, was Jake Cothren, a KCC student who lives in Momence. Dircks was the second place winner.</div>

<div>Dircks also won the third event, a 1/2-inch fillet on low-carbon steel using the SMAW (shield metal arc welding) process. Frank Orisini of Minooka finished second.<br></div>
<div>Orsini won the fourth event, a low-carbon 3-inch schedule 40 pipe to a plate in the 5F position using GTAW (gas tungsten arc welding). Second place went to Josh Lindmark of Minooka.</div>
<div><br>The fifth event, a student-only SMAW (shield metal arc welding) event, was won by Mitchell Grise of Manteno, a student at the Kankakee Area Career Center. Second place went to Jason Hand of Kankakee. Hand is a KCC student.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Judging was by a panel of AWS certified welding inspectors. <br></div>
<div>The event was hosted by KCC; the Joliet, Aurora, Kankakee section of the American Welding Society; and the JAK-3 student chapter of the AWS. Event sponsors were Peddinghaus Corporation, Pratt Gasses and welding supplies, Lincoln Electric, Kankakee Speedway and Stevenson Fabrication.<br></div></div></div>
