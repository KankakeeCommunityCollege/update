<div>KCC students are learning what happens when different health disciplines coordinate their efforts.<br /></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Through four simulations, students in five different health programs experienced – perhaps for the first time – the interprofessional coordination that occurs in the workplace.</div>
<div><br />“We wanted different disciplines to understand each other’s roles in taking care of a patient,” said Sheri Cagle, associate dean of health careers at KCC. “It helps students see the big picture.”<br /></div>
<div>One important skill students learn during exercises such as this is effective communication, which is a key component of patient safety, said Kim DeYoung, a KCC nursing professor who coordinated much of the simulation. <br /></div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Joint Commission, which accredits and certifies more than 20,000 health care organizations and programs in the United States, estimates that 80 percent of serious medical errors involve ineffective communication between caregivers when patients are transferred or handed-off. </div>
<div><br />In addition, the Institute of Medicine identified interprofessional teamwork as a core competency for all health care providers in 2003 and reinforced the conclusion in the 2011 report, “The Future of Nursing: Leading Change, Advancing Health.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“This exercise is a way to reinforce standardized communication strategies and examine the priorities of care which unfold in a given patient situation,” DeYoung said. “This is preparing them to enter the workforce so they can understand the team approach across health disciplines.” </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Students from five of KCC’s health career programs were brought together for the simulation. In the course of two days and four separate exercises, 53 students from Radiography, Emergency Medical Technician/Paramedic, Nursing, Medical Laboratory Technology and Respiratory Therapist took part.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each simulation began with a student acting as a patient with a health emergency in the home. EMT/Paramedic students were called and gave initial treatment to stabilize the patient. The paramedic students transported the patient to KCC’s simulation lab. At that point, paramedic and nursing students conducted a hand-off report and I-Stan took over the patient role. I-Stan is an advanced patient simulator with internal robotics that mimic human </div>
<div>cardiovascular, respiratory and neurological systems.</div>
<div><br />The team continued work on I-Stan, with students in each discipline participating. Nursing and respiratory therapist students assessed, intervened, and evaluated patient care. A radiography student took X-rays and a medical laboratory technology student obtained blood samples.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I-Stan reacts like a patient, but in a safe environment,” said DeYoung. “With this scenario, if the students make a correct clinical decision, the ‘patient’ got better. If the clinical decision was incorrect, the condition worsened and required additional actions.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The simulations were video recorded by participants wearing GoPro® cameras as well as a non-participant who used traditional video. Afterward, the students watched to see where they could improve and to give non-participating students a view into how certain objectives were met. </div>
<div><br />“It was a great experience,” said Thomas Sandeno, an Emergency Medical Technician student. “I'm sure the video will help up-in-coming health care personnel!”</div>
