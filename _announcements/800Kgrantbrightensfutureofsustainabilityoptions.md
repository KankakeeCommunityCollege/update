<p>In 2008, Ryan Duncan was employed, but jobs like his were being eliminated or sent overseas. He enrolled at Kankakee Community College to seek a career change.</p>
<div style="padding-right:15px;float:left"><img alt="Ryan Duncan on the job" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Ryan-Duncan-on-the-job-med.jpg"></div>
<div style="float:left">In his second semester at KCC, he heard about renewable energy training courses. Soon he was studying electrical technology with a renewable energy focus at KCC. He continued to work full-time while going to KCC. Duncan earned a certificate from the electrical technology program in May 2011. He also completed certificates in Small Wind Technology and Solar PV Technology.</div>
<p>Even before he finished at KCC, Duncan was offered a full-time job with benefits and opportunities for advancement. </p>
<p>Now, the 28-year-old Watseka resident is a service technician for utility-scale wind turbines. He operates and maintains the 53-turbine Hoosier Wind Farm in Goodland, Ind.</p>
<p>“The biggest benefit of the KCC program was that grants gave us the opportunity for hands-on training,” Duncan said. “We used actual solar panels and put up real turbines.”</p>
<p>With an $855,000 grant from the National Science Foundation, KCC will be able to train even more students for jobs in the emerging industry of renewable energy technology.</p>
<p>“Future jobs depend on developing skills in energy technology,” said John Avendano, KCC president. “This grant award allows the college to further develop our specialization in training renewable energy technicians. We plan to develop and expand this program at the pace of business and manufacturing growth.”</p>
<p>KCC will use the grant, from the National Science Foundation’s Division of Undergraduate Education’s Advanced Technology Program, to launch a project called “C4: Community Colleges Confronting the Conundrum.” The “conundrum” is whether to train technicians for renewable energy jobs that don’t yet exist, or to establish strategies to create renewable energy jobs.</p>
<p>“Our answer is to do both and at the same time,” said Tim Wilhelm, who will direct the C4 grant. “Market development is a key component of the C4 strategy.”</p>

<div style="float:left">The new project builds upon a previous 30-month National Science Foundation Advanced Technological Education Program grant which was funded from September 2008 to February 2011. The first grant supported the development of three certificates in renewable energy technologies. </div>
<p>Tim, who is KCC’s Electrical Technology Program coordinator, also directed the first NSF grant at KCC.</p>
<p>The college will use the new grant to help create solar photovoltaic training sites throughout the Midwest. KCC will establish a C4 training center on campus in partnership with the Midwest Renewable Energy Association of Wisconsin. The C4 center will be replicated at six other community colleges: one each in Indiana, Iowa, Ohio, Michigan, Minnesota and Michigan. Eventually, the model will be available to community colleges nationally. </p>
<p>“C4 applies to any renewable energy technology, but KCC’s project begins with a focus on solar photovoltaic technology,” Wilhelm said. “Our research shows no other college with a comparable model. Part of the issue for growing renewable energy employment across the country is cultivating market development for employers. We are the first ones to make market development a serious aspect of our training program.”</p>
<p>“We have worked hard to accomplish Interstate Renewable Energy Council accreditation – the gold standard in accreditation for renewable energy training,” said Vicki Magee, director of institutional research and co-author, along with Tim, of the grant application. “We are the only college in Illinois with an accredited solar training program and the only one with a solar Certified Master Trainer (Tim) on faculty.</p>
<p>“Aligned with NSF’s goals, C4’s goals are to improve undergraduate technology education, infuse the job market transformation model into community colleges’ existing renewable energy programs, and to enhance the infrastructure for renewable energy technician training at community colleges.”</p>
<p>“The project’s broadest impact will be on faculty and students at small, rural community colleges across the U.S.,” noted Tim. “KCC will continually enhance its course content to reflect changes in the market, and the model will impact local economies by helping overcome common barriers to building the renewable energy market.</p>
<p>“We hope people get excited about this potential career path, and want to learn more. I encourage anyone curious about renewable energy to enroll in KCC’s Survey of Renewable Energy Technology course. It’s the first course in the curriculum, and it is designed for anyone interested in the topic. It’s a good first step whether a person is thinking about putting solar on their home, or to explore if this career path is right for you.”</p>
<p>The National Science Foundation receives approximately 40,000 proposals each year for research, education and training projects. Of them, 11,000 are funded.</p>
<p>The purpose of the NSF is to promote the progress of science; and to advance the national health, prosperity, and welfare by supporting research and education in all fields of science and engineering. NSF funds grants and cooperative agreements for research and education in most fields of science and engineering to more than 2,000 colleges, universities, kindergarten through twelfth grade (K-12) school systems, businesses, informal science organizations and other research organizations throughout the U.S.</p>
