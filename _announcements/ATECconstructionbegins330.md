<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass66A45541C23B427A85A68BB1D50AD463"><p style="color:#00558d">​Editor's note: This contains new information about a portion of College Drive being closed at the beginning of construction.</p>
<p>Construction will begin on the new Advanced Technology Education Center (ATEC) on Monday, March 30.</p>
<p>The contractor will first install a construction fence around the site—directly south of the Technology Building including the adjacent employee parking lot (P6). A <a href="/Community/Collegeinfo/Documents/Riverfront-map.pdf">map showing parking lot numbers</a> is on the college directions page.</p>
<p>Starting at 6 a.m. Monday, March 30, staff should park in the lot west of the Technology Building (Lot P13). Drop-off and pick-up for the Child Development Center will be moved to the circle drive west of the Health Careers Center for Excellence (M Building) and south of the Arts &amp; Sciences Building (R Building). The River Valley Metro bus stop will remain open. </p>
<p>A portion of College Drive, the main road into the Riverfront Campus, will be closed. The portion that is closed is expected to re-open before the Fall 2015 semester begins.</p>
<p>A portion of Parking lot P4, an open parking area south of the Technology Building, will be closed during construction.</p>
<p>If there are any questions regarding the construction or parking plan, please phone or email <a href="mailto:rkenney@kcc.edu">Rob Kenney</a> at 815-802-8194 or <a href="mailto:rsoderquist@kcc.edu">Rich Soderquist</a> at 815-802-8173.<br /></p>
