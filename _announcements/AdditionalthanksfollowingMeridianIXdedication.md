<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass8A9722B16E074B3DABB06CBB704792AD">The artist who created Meridian IX has additional thanks to share which were not included during the  dedication ceremony held Thursday, Oct. 6.</div>
<div class="ExternalClass8A9722B16E074B3DABB06CBB704792AD"><br />&quot;Here are some local names--good, good people who have stood by me, in collaboration, on this project and over the years, in some cases reaching back to 1980,&quot; said Ed McCullough, the sculptor. &quot;The 'finger prints' of these folks are all over my work.”</div>
<div class="ExternalClass8A9722B16E074B3DABB06CBB704792AD"><br />In a note to Kari Sargeant, KCC director of marketing and public relations, McCullough said &quot;I meant to give recognition to you and other people yesterday for making lots of things happen throughout the development of M-IX.&quot;</div>
<div class="ExternalClass8A9722B16E074B3DABB06CBB704792AD"><br />Following, in his own words, are the others McCullough mentioned in his follow-up: </div>
<div class="ExternalClass8A9722B16E074B3DABB06CBB704792AD">
<ul>
<li>Airgas North Central - Dave Silva. Simply &quot;one of the best.&quot; When you really need something and just can't get it, he makes it appear by the next morning!</li>
<li>Pratt Supply - been with them since 1980. It's &quot;family.&quot;</li>
<li>Douglas Crane Co. - absolutely nothing happens with a sculpture installation without a good crane operator. These guys &quot;set the standard.&quot;</li>
<li>Albers Auto - keeping my trucks &amp; vehicles ready for work!</li>
<li>L&amp;G Radiator - same as above.</li>
<li>Father Lee Ryan my Priest - for keeping me ready for work and more!</li>
<li>Jean Janssen - she is such a great person, and in my book the consumate professional.</li>
<li>Vicki Gardner - what can I say? She's family!</li>
<li>KCC's President, Dr John Avendano - first impression holds: a good man at the helm.</li>
<li>Rich Soderquist - also the best! Our fathers were &quot;iron workers&quot; who worked long ago, but at different times, for The Whiting Co. Spooky. Go figure.</li>
<li>KCC Maintenace and food service folks - Just flat-out good people.</li>
<li>Ellen Skelly - she got my &quot;smart locker&quot; functioning right with some timely suggestions about words and thoughts intended to go public.</li>
<li>The folks who did the site preparation (concrete work, etc) where M-IX now exists did an outstanding job.<br />Yesterday I mentioned Ron Metzka, at Woodys EMS, and the folks at S&amp;S Sheetmetal. Ditto for Art Suprenant.</li>
<li>Illinois Fabricators, in Bradley  - They went out of business a month or two ago. It was like a death in the family. In the work I do, you never get over a loss like this. It was family. Still is!<br /> </li></ul></div>
