<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassF45D2D271F044AD5B15E857F78126CCE"><p>​A job fair to learn about part-time teaching opportunities at KCC will be held March 25.<br /><br />The “Adjunct Faculty Job Fair” will be from 5-7 p.m. Wednesday, March 25 in the Iroquois Room at KCC.<br /><br />Part-time instructors are needed in many college departments, both credit and non-credit, according to Dr. Michael Boyd, KCC vice president for instruction and student success. Areas where part-time faculty may be needed include accounting, business, mathematics, science, health careers, industrial technology, automotive, electrical, speech, English, adult education, continuing education, Microsoft applications, welding and metal fabrication. <br /> <br />“Teaching part-time is a win-win situation in almost every instance,” Boyd said. “For the instructor, there is additional part-time income, a chance to network with other professionals and to make a difference in the community. For the college and its students, the part-time instructor brings in fresh applications of the course subject and a close link to current work environments.”<br /> <br />Qualifications for part-time instructors in most college departments are a minimum of a bachelor’s degree and work experience in the area to be taught. For transfer courses, a master’s degree is required, along with 18 or more graduate hours in the field of discipline.  For courses in the college’s Business and Technology Division, a bachelor’s degree is not always required.<br /><br />For more information on adjunct teaching opportunities or the March 25 Adjunct Faculty Job Fair, contact the Office of Human Resources at 815-802-8125.</p>
