<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass52F2494D3E6548DDAA11D24827D4B50C"><p>​The Rev. Dr. Scott Lemenager, an adjunct professor at KCC since 2001, has recently returned from his third trip to Africa. </p>
<p>Scott took a small team to Jos, Nigeria, for work and observation at the Nigerian Bible Translation Trust. He visited and worked at the compound in the city of Jos. Scott also has visited and worked in the country of Uganda.  Scott teaches World Religions and said he &quot;feels that it is important to visit as many places as possible to see first-hand the impact of what people believe and how they practice what they believe.&quot;</p>
