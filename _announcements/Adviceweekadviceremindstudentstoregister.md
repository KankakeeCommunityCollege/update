<p>Please help promote Fall 2016 Registration by wearing a free &quot;Registered Yet?&quot; T-shirt April 11-15, on campus and off!</p>
<p>There are some still available (size small) at the main reception desk on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>All week, please remind students with whom you interact to register early (<a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Fall2016Registration.pdf">handout on Early Registration Prizes</a>), think about their schedules, consider balancing their time wisely, and set a goal to complete. </p>
<p>Additionally, remind students who may be enrolled in developmental coursework that there are several newly re-designed courses for the Fall 2016 (<a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/NewCourseExplanations.pdf">Explanation of Coursework handout</a>) that will save them time and money. Encourage them to ask their instructors or advisors about these courses. Students can also re-test in Accuplacer upon successful completion of a course to improve their scores and possibly move directly in to credit-bearing coursework. The retest fee is $10.</p>
<p>The <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/DatestoKnow.pdf">following dates are important</a> to note and share.</p>
<ul><li>Online registration is under way. </li>
<li>Students with completed Master Academic Plans are welcome to register without the help of advising. Check KCConnect for information on Self-Service-Student Planning.</li>
<li>On-campus registration begins Monday, April 11. Contact Student Services to make your appointment today.</li>
<li>Payment for Fall 2016 courses is due Aug. 5.</li>
