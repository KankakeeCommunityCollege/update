<div>Michael Boyd, Ph.D., an experienced teacher and administrator, has been selected as the next vice president for instruction and student success at KCC.</div>
<div><br />Dr. Boyd is currently associate dean of English, Humanities and Language Studies at Illinois Central College in Peoria. He will be KCC’s chief academic officer, responsible for administering the college’s credit and non-credit instruction and workforce development programs. Dr. Boyd has accepted the position at KCC effective May 19.</div>
<div><br />“I look forward to becoming engaged in the Kankakee area’s educational initiatives,” Dr. Boyd said. “We will be working hard to achieve further successes associated with college readiness, developmental education and college completion goals.”</div>
<div><br />Dr. Boyd began his career at Morton High School, where he was a teacher for six years. He joined the staff at Illinois Central College in Peoria in 2006, where he served as an associate professor and teaching chair before being selected for his current position. Also at Illinois Central, he served for one year as a Six Sigma Black Belt, working with teams throughout the college to manage processes and make improvements.</div>
<div><br />“Dr. Michael Boyd is an enthusiastic leader who has impressive experience and is committed to the community college mission,” said Dr. John Avendano, KCC president. “He is focused on student success, starting at the earliest levels of education. With a strong understanding of high school processes, college teaching environments, and Six Sigma Black Belt experience managing effective solutions, Dr. Boyd is going to be part of a lot of progressive opportunities at KCC and we are excited to have him join our team.”</div>
<div><br />Dr. Boyd also has experience as a peer reviewer for two organizations, the National Association of Developmental Education and the Higher Learning Commission. The Higher Learning Commission is one of six regional institutional accreditors of colleges, including KCC.</div>
<div><br />Dr. Boyd has earned three degrees from Illinois State University: a bachelor’s degree in English education, a master’s degree in English studies and a doctorate in English studies.</div>
<div><br />Dr. Boyd will fill the position currently held by Dennis Sorensen. He will retire from KCC at the end of May, following almost 30 years of service as a KCC instructor and administrator. </div>
<div><br />Dr. Boyd currently lives in Washington, which is near Peoria. Along with his wife, Maureen, and their four children, the Boyd’s are planning to move to the Kankakee area.</div>
