<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass312030668C8840DB951112B49BF1EDE8"><p>​The annual Halloween contest will be on Monday, Oct. 31.</p>
<p>For nine years, areas of the college have competed against each other for the best Halloween costumes and department theme.</p>
<p>&quot;The main campus has held this fantastic annual competition for almost 10 years now,” said Sheila Pfaff, one of the competition organizers. &quot;I have been haunted by everyone’s great efforts from last year. We cannot wait to see what the competition brings out of the cobwebs. Get those ideas flowing and join us!&quot;</p>
<p><img alt="trophy.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/trophy.jpg" style="margin:5px" /><br />Each area's theme must be kept under wraps to keep the competition from borrowing ideas. As an incentive, the winning department will keep the “Fabulous” Traveling Tacky Trophy (above) and will be able to show it off until the 2017 competition.</p>
<p><img alt="costume.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/costume.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />There also will be a Traveling Tacky Trophy for best costume (at right). The winner of the best costume does not have to be part of one of the office/area themes.</p>
<p>If your department or staff in your area would like to get into the spirit of the day, please contact Sheila Pfaff, <a href="mailto:spfaff@kcc.edu">spfaff@kcc.edu</a> or 815-802-8704, by Friday, Oct. 21.</p></div></div>
