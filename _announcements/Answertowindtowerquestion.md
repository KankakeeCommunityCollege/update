<div>A recent candid comment was submitted regarding the wind tower. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here's the question and answer:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Question:</strong> </div>
<div>I have been asked by several people in the community why the windmill is not spinning and I have no answer for them. Could something be put in the KCC Update or somewhere else so that we can inform the community should we be asked?</div>
<div><br /><strong>Answer:</strong></div>
<div>(From Bert Jacobsen, dean of environmental and institutional sustainability) From time to time the turbine stops because the wind is too weak or too strong. Currently, there is an equipment problem. KCC has been in contact with Midwest Underground Technologies, Inc. (MUTI) who are responsible for maintenance on the wind turbine. A field technician will be at KCC within a week to resolve the issue which seems to have started with a failed fuse. We expect the turbine to be returned to service in a week or so.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Over the past year, the turbine has performed as expected, producing 85,600 kilowatt hours (kWh) of renewable energy for the campus, enough to provide a year's worth of electricity for eight average households.</div>
