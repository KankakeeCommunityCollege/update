<div>On Monday, Nov. 4, there will be two events to benefit the KCC United Way campaign. Both are inspired by the Monday Night Football matchup between the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>First, Monday will be a denim day/casual day for anyone who donates $5 to the KCC United Way campaign. Donations can be taken to the Human Resources Office. As an exception to the usual denim day guidelines, participants will have the option to wear a Bears or Packers shirt/jersey. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Notes: Please see the casual day guidelines at the end of this article. There will be another casual day for United Way on Friday, Nov. 1. Read about it <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Lists/Announcements/DispForm2.aspx?List=7e45450e-520d-4ad3-81dd-a79ebcc75df4&amp;ID=1303&amp;Source=/_layouts/sitemanager.aspx?FilterOnly%3D1&amp;SmtContext=SPList%3a7e45450e-520d-4ad3-81dd-a79ebcc75df4?SPWeb%3a6dd7d01a-f4b3-47f9-8d35-b60692caa2f7%3a&amp;SmtContextExpanded=True&amp;Filter=1&amp;pgsz=100&amp;vrmode=False&amp;lvn=Unexpired%20Announcements&amp;Web=6dd7d01a-f4b3-47f9-8d35-b60692caa2f7">here</a>.</div>

<div>Second, there will be a tailgate lunch special in Food Service on Monday, Nov. 4. All day, Food Service will offer the choice of a chicken breast, hamburger or brat patty; plus bag of chips, baked beans, pasta salad and a can of soda. The price for the special will be $5.25 plus tax. For every lunch served, 50¢ will be donated to United Way!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>United Way’s work is divided into four categories: education, income, health &amp; wellness, and basic needs. United Way of Kankakee County supports 45 local programs and 24 member agencies, serving more than 65,000 people per year. Your support is appreciated!</div>
