<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassFA9DB12CE27541DC87936BD5E35BCB2A>
<div>In October, artwork that belongs to the KCC permanent art collection will be on display in the lower level of the Learning Resource Center.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;Most of these works are scattered throughout the college, in hallways, stairways, and offices,&quot; said Jean Janssen, art professor. &quot;I will be locating these works in the next two weeks and contacting everyone who has work belonging to the collection.&quot;</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The art department will “borrow” the work for about five weeks, beginning in late September or early October. </div>
<div>&quot;We will take very good care&quot; of the works, Jean said. &quot;Some of the works have not been seen by the public in many years. Also, many works need care and repair, so this is a great time to look them all over and make sure they are well maintained.&quot;</div>
<div> </div>
<div>An email will be sent to those who will be affected because there is a piece for the show is in their office or work area. The email will include the dates the piece will be removed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyone with questions is invited to contact Jean at <br><a href="mailto:jjanssen@kcc.edu">jjanssen@kcc.edu</a> or phone 815-802-8719.</div>
