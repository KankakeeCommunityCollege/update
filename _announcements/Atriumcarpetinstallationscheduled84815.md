<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassA24BB5ECCC734D83939ACB468F400E24">
<div>      </div>
<div>From Aug. 4 to 15, the Atrium area that was not re-carpeted a few years ago will have new carpeting installed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The replacement will be done in sections to help avoid disruption.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>During one phase of the project, the area from the Child Development Center to the Hammes Café will be blocked. The door from the Health Careers Center for Excellence will be blocked as well. The doors by the west elevator will be open for traffic to and from the HCCE and the Technology Buildings. Exterior doors also will be open for walking outside between the main entrance and Prairie Building.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When the Hammes Café area is completed, the west end elevator doors to the Atrium will be closed. The west elevator and stairs will still be accessible from the Health Careers Center for Excellence, and the exterior entrance/exit will be open as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The stairways by the reception desk and the west elevator will be open during re-carpeting. The Child Development Center will be accessible from either the east or west, depending on what stage the project is at.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Barriers and signage will help direct staff and students. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation during this construction period.</div>
