<div> Dr. John Avendano, president of KCC, has received the Shirley B. Gordon Award of Distinction from Phi Theta Kappa honor society.</div>
<div><br />Avendano is one of just 22 college presidents and campus CEOs who received the honor April 6 in San Jose, Calif. Selection for the award is based on outstanding efforts given toward promoting the goals of Phi Theta Kappa. </div>
<div><br />“Dr. John Avendano has been an avid supporter of student development and academic excellence for years, and Phi Theta Kappa is a prime organization that focuses on both,” said Joshua Beneze, a KCC student who currently serves as central district regional vice-president for the Illinois region of Phi Theta Kappa. “Dr. Avendano has actively supported the projects initiated by Phi Theta Kappa and also encourages raising community awareness each year through his participation and personal advocacy. There are few who deserve the honor of the Shirley B. Gordon Award of Distinction. Dr. Avendano is among those few.”</div>
<div><br />“Through Phi Theta Kappa, I am honored to support the students of KCC,” Avendano said. “By getting involved, helping their community and striving for even higher academic understanding, these students are making the most of their college experience. They are leaders at our institution and future leaders in whatever paths they travel. It is an honor to be recognized by this organization.”</div>
<div><br />Among his noteworthy activities, Avendano serves as a liaison between the Illinois Council of Community College Presidents and the Illinois Region of Phi Theta Kappa. In this role, which he has held for three years, he works with colleagues to create awareness and activate dormant chapters of the organization.</div>
<div><br />“Dr. Avendano works with Phi Theta Kappa student leaders and allows us to use our creativity in identifying initiatives and in proposing solutions to identified concerns,” Beneze said.</div>
<div><br />With Avendano’s support, the KCC chapter made it a goal to re-attain the highest level of recognition for chapter activity—the 5 Star status. In total, KCC’s Alpha Delta Eta chapter has now reached the pinnacle “5 Star status” 11 times, including the last three years.</div>
<div><br />Before becoming KCC’s president in July 2009 and during the 14 years he worked at Illinois Central College in Peoria, Avendano attended and participated in nearly every Phi Theta Kappa induction. While at Illinois Central and KCC, he also has supported two campaigns for students running for international office in Phi Theta Kappa. </div>
<div><br />In October 2009 and February 2012, Avendano was made an honorary member of Phi Theta Kappa. He also has received the Phi Theta Kappa Distinguished Administrator Award.<br /></div>
<div><br />Phi Theta Kappa is an international academic honor society for community college students. To be eligible for membership, students must have a 3.5 grade point average or better on a 4.0 scale. </div>
<div><br />Phi Theta Kappa has recognized academic excellence in the two-year college since 1918. It is the largest honor society in American higher education, with more than 2 million members. The society offers opportunities for scholarships, intellectual enrichment, and personal development through programs based on the society’s hallmarks of scholarship, leadership, service, and fellowship.</div>
<div><br />The Shirley B. Gordon Award of Distinction is named for the late Dr. Shirley B. Gordon, Phi Theta Kappa’s longest serving board of directors chair and president emeritus of Highline Community College in Des Moines, Wash. </div>
