<div>The Baccalaureate Scholars Program is welcoming guest speakers each week as part of the leadership development component of the program.</div>
<div><br />“On Wednesday, Sept. 11, the group was honored to have Col. James Kasler (Ret.) as their guest,” said Susan LaMore, coordinator of the Baccalaureate Scholars Program. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In introducing Kasler, Susan paraphrased the forward to his biography, <em>Tempered Steel, The Three Wars of Triple Air Force Cross Winner James Kasler,</em> by saying “In this era of false celebrity, entertainment and pursuit of wealth, meeting Col. Kasler today and having the opportunity to hear him is a chance to experience the deeds and thoughts of a remarkable hero and a great American.”</div>
<div><br />Kasler is a Momence resident and the former owner of South Shore Golf Course. He is the only person, alive or dead, to have earned three Air Force Crosses.<br /></div>
<div>“Col. Kasler spent the hour telling the students about his experiences in World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War,” Susan said. “He was shot down in North Vietnam and was a prisoner of war for nearly seven years. Col. Kasler told the students that -- while enduring deplorable conditions and torture -- thinking about future plans for a golf course was one thing that helped him keep going.”</div>
<div><br />In coming weeks, guests of the scholars will include representatives from the Illinois Community College Board, the Kankakee Development Corporation, HomeStar Bank, KCC and other community business and government agencies. </div>
<div><br />KCC’s Baccalaureate Scholars Program is a competitive-entry, two-year program for academically talented and motivated students. It provides a stimulating learning environment for students who exhibit academic excellence. Baccalaureate Scholars pursue challenging programs of study that meet their educational goals and the requirements of the four-year college or university to which they plan to transfer. The scholars receive full-ride scholarships to attend KCC covering tuition, fees and books.<br /></div>
