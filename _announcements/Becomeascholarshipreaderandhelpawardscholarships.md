<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE2D5DD5EDB5A411AB5D0896F1E142CAA"><p>​The Foundation scholarship cycle is in full swing, and students are currently applying for next year's awards.</p>
<p>After the scholarship deadline of March 1, committee members are needed to review the applications. Committees read and rate the applications and essays of applicants. Scholarship reading is online using a NextGen software.</p>
<p>&quot;We value your time and will make every effort to add you to no more than three committees,&quot; said Aindrea Hogan, coordinator of scholarships and alumni relations. </p>
<p>Most committees read between five and 25 scholarship applications. The time commitment ranges from one to three hours per committee, she said.</p>
<p>&quot;Scholarship readers have the opportunity to better understand student’s needs and learn about the challenges that they face,&quot; Aindrea said.</p>
<p>To become a scholarship reader, contact Andrea at 815-802-8251 or <a href="mailto:ahogan@kcc.edu">email</a> her.<br /></p></div></div>
