With the help of local artisans and the Power of Community, they are a winning combination this year. </p>
<p>When we put plans together to celebrate our 50th anniversary, we set out to capture the stories, experiences and partnerships that best described our tagline - the Power of Community. The planning team turned to local partners to help us celebrate. What sips and treats would put everyone in a party mood at our events?  Well, beer is usually a good idea, and nothing says “party” like cupcakes. </p>
<p>Kelly Myers, executive director of the KCC Foundation, went to work. She talked with Wanda Warman at <a href="http://www.nanascookiesandmore.com/">Nana’s Cakery</a> and Tommy Vasilakis from Brickstone Brewery, and they thought it was a great fit.  </p>

The KCC cupcake is adorned with white frosting, edges rolled in gold metallic sprinkles and an edible KCC 50th anniversary logo on top. It’s almost too pretty to eat. They are available for special order, and we will serve them at most of our anniversary events.</p>
<p><img width="337" height="447" alt="KCC tapper" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/KCC_tapper.jpg" style="height:255px;vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px;width:191px" />To create our beer, <a href="http://www.brickstonebrewery.com/">Brickstone Brewery</a> hosted KCC’s President, Dr. John Avendano, and small group of connoisseurs to select flavor, taste and aroma. They decided on a French Farmhouse Ale as a nod to our region’s French-Canadian heritage. The Brickstone brewmaster created a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saison">Saison</a> – a smooth, easy-drinking Farmhouse Ale.</p>
<p>Cavaliers seemed to be a good fit as the name. It easily represents KCC. The college was established in 1966 and the beer is 6.6% alcohol by volume, so ’66 came to the forefront as well. Voilà – Cavaliers ’66.</p>
<p>We can all enjoy it until it’s gone! Brickstone made 20 kegs. Some are set aside for anniversary events, including the Employee Recognition Event in November, <a href="/athletics/cavclub/Pages/default.aspx">Cavalier Club</a> Cash Bash in March, and our Anniversary Gala in May. The rest of Cavaliers ‘66 is for sale at Brickstone Brewery in Bourbonnais. The owners are establishing a <a href="/future/paying/scholarships/Pages/default.aspx">KCC scholarship</a> with the proceeds. So, go and enjoy a pint (or two) and know that you’re supporting students. <br /></p></div></div>
