<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassD9E98CB10D9248F1AD3BF8BA6F6E7FC9><div>KCC is concerned about the care, welfare, safety and security of everyone and is committed to providing an environment in which individuals are free to work, learn and teach without threats of intimidation and harm. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Campus Threat Assessment policy follows Illinois mandate Title 29: Emergency Services, Disasters, and Civil Defense, Section 305.80, Campus Threat Assessment Team (Behavioral Intervention Team).</div>
<div><br>Each higher education institution is required to develop and implement a Campus Threat Assessment Team to address behavior that could pose a threat to the campus community or facility. Students and employees of the college are usually the first to notice when a member of the community is distressed or behaving in a potentially dangerous or disruptive manner.</div>
<div><br>The goal of the Behavioral Intervention Team is to promote a safe environment for all students and staff. The team encourages members of the campus community to report behaviors that are concerning. This action enables intervention, support, and quick connections to appropriate resources. The team includes personnel from faculty, campus security, counseling, disability services, health care administration, and student services and human resources.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Kankakee Police Department is involved as appropriate. The team also provides education about services at the college and in the community, including mental health services, crisis management and services for victims.<br>The college offers information sessions to students and employees on “Identifying Red Flag Behaviors” throughout the semester.</div>
<div><br>The Behavioral Intervention Team invites suggestions to improve its services and resources. Contact Michelle Driscoll, assistant dean of student services, at <a href="mailto:mdriscoll@kcc.edu">mdriscoll@kcc.edu</a>, 815-802-8524.</div>
<div><br>For more information on other emergency management efforts, contact Rich Soderquist, <a href="mailto:rsoderquist@kcc.edu">rsoderquist@kcc.edu</a>, or 815-802-8173.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><font color="#000080">Reporting a concern</font></strong></div><strong><font color="#000080">
<div><br></font></strong>Emergency concerns: Call 911, or call KCC security at 5555 from any campus phone.</div>
<div><br>Non-emergency referrals: e-mail <a href="mailto:bit@kcc.edu">bit@kcc.edu</a>, or phone the assistant dean of student services at 815-802-8524 or phone KCC security’s non-emergency number, 815-802-8190.<br>All concerns and reports are confidential.</div>
<div><br>By reporting concerns about individuals who display odd, suicidal and/or aggressive behaviors, you provide the college with the opportunity to address the behavior before an outburst occurs or the problem escalates to an aggressive action.<br></div></div></div>
