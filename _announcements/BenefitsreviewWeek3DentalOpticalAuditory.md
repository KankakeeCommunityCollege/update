<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass91DC36E5C0DD48299116589C179D770C"><p>It’s almost time to renew your benefits!</p>
<p><img width="460" height="460" alt="Clock" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/clock.jpg" style="height:144px;vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px;width:144px" />Time is quickly approaching for the full-time employee’s open enrollment period which is Nov. 2-23. The Employee Benefits Fair will be taking on a new look this year. Save the date: 11/2/16! Until then, Human Resources will highlight a specific benefit each week.</p>
<p>This week we are highlighting KCC’s full-time employee dental/optical/auditory benefit program. </p>
<p style="color:darkblue">Features of the dental/optical/auditory reimbursement:</p>
<ul><li>An annualized amount of $600 is credited to each full-time employee on Jan. 1 of each calendar year. </li>
<li>The $600 credit is earned at a rate of $50 per month, but may be used throughout the calendar year.</li>
<li>Employees starting after Jan. 1 receive a pro-rated amount.</li>
<li>The balance at the end of the year can be up to a max of $1,200.</li>
<li>The fund may be used to offset the cost of the dental insurance premiums through Principal and/or to reimburse eligible dental, optical or auditory expenses paid to you or your provider.</li>
<li>Reimbursements may be made for full-time employees, spouses, and their dependent family under age 23.</li></ul>
<p style="color:darkblue">Features of the dental insurance option:</p>
<ul><li>Dental insurance coverage options are: employee, employee/spouse, family, employee/child.</li>
<li>The dental insurance cost per pay period varies depending on the coverage selected and if the dollars are used to offset the expense. You will see the rates during the “Open Enrollment” process.</li>
<li>More information about dental insurance offered by Principal is in the “Understand Your Benefits” booklet, available in Human Resources.</li>
<li>If you are enrolled for dental insurance through Principal (KCC’s carrier), you may also take advantage of vision care discounts and savings through VSP (a discount card is in the benefits booklet or see a human resources representative).</li></ul>
<p>It will soon be the only time of the year you can enroll or make a change to your dental insurance coverage, Such changes can only be made during the open enrollment period of Nov. 2-23, or when you have a “Qualifying Event.”</p>
<p>Next week’s article will highlight the <a href="http://www.surs.org/">State Universities Retirement System</a> retirement plan.</p>
