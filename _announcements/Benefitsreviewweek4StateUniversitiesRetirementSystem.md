<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1E4BFE01A5C84125B345100E7EBE0E5E"><p>It’s almost time to renew your benefits!</p>
<p>The open enrollment period for full-time employees, Nov. 7-23, is quickly approaching. The Employee Benefits Fair will take on a new look this year. Save the (new) date: 11/7/16! Until then, Human Resources will highlight a specific benefit each week.</p>
<p><img width="460" height="459" alt="Clock" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/clock.jpg" style="height:138px;vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px;width:138px" />This week we are highlighting the <a href="http://www.surs.org/">State Universities Retirement System</a>. SURS provides retirement income, disability coverage and survivor’s benefits.  Here are a few FAQs:</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How much do I contribute to SURS?<br /><strong>A.</strong> Your contribution is 8% of gross earnings. Full-time employees pay an additional .5% of earnings to fund a health insurance plan for community college retirees.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> How much does my employer contribute?<br /><strong>A.</strong>  In most cases, the employer’s contribution to your pension is made by the state of Illinois. The amount for Traditional and Portable is determined actuarially each year. The state’s contribution to the Self-Managed Plan equals 7.6% of earnings. Of that, 7.3% goes directly to the members' account and the remainder provides eligibility for disability benefits.</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>How do I register/re-register on the Member website?<br /><strong>A. </strong>Click to walk through the <a href="http://www.surs.com/sites/default/files/pdfsx/Guide-to-Registration.pdf">registration process</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>How do I learn more about the Traditional, Portable, or Self-Managed plans?<br /><strong>A.</strong>  On the <a href="http://www.surs.org/">SURS website</a>, choose the “Retirement Plans” tab to learn more about your specific plan.</p>
<p>If you are within four years of retirement you can schedule a private appointment with a SURS Retirement Counselor. You are allowed one session every 12 months. The meetings are 30 minutes and specific to you.</p>
<p>Here are a few more FAQ’s:</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> When am I eligible to retire?<br /><strong>A.</strong> If participation first began prior to Jan. 1, 2011:</p>
<ul><li>Age 55 with 8 or more years of service, with applicable age reduction</li>
<li>Age 62 with 5 or more years of service</li>
<li>Any age with 30 or more years of service (not applicable if employment termination prior to Aug. 2, 2002)</li></ul>
<p>If participation first began on or after January 1, 2011:</p>
<ul><li>At age 62 with 10 or more years of service, with applicable age reduction</li>
<li>At age 67 with 10 or more years of service</li></ul>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> When should I file my application for retirement?<br /><strong>A.</strong> SURS would like to receive your application 60-90 days prior to your effective date of retirement.</p>
<p>To supplement your retirement, you may elect to defer part of your salary in the form a 403(b) annuity. This may be done through our third party administrator, <a href="https://www.omni403b.com/employers.aspx">Omni Group</a>. If you are interested, come ask about it at the Employee Benefits Fair.</p>
