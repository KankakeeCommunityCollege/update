<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass6BC7772BBADB43A9A606B1E279213D5C"><p>​It’s almost time to renew your benefits!</p>
<p><img width="459" height="460" alt="Clock" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/clock.jpg" style="height:112px;vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px;width:112px" />Time is quickly approaching for the full-time employee open enrollment period which is Nov. 7-23. The Employee Benefits Fair will be taking on a new look this year. This is our final benefits highlight before the Benefits Fair on Monday, Nov. 7.</p>
<p>This week, we are highlighting Flex Spending, Life, Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment, Long-term Disability Insurance and the Tuition Reduction &amp; Reimbursement program. </p>
<p style="color:darkblue"><strong>Flex Spending</strong></p>
<p>This benefit is administered by Benefit Planning Consultants. It allows full-time employees to set aside pre-tax dollars each pay period into an account to be used for the reimbursement or purchase of:</p>
<ul><li>Dental or optical expenses</li>
<li>Health care related items, co-pays, deductibles, prescription drugs (find a complete list on <a href="https://fsastore.com/?a_aid=504650637a81e&amp;utm_source=msn&amp;utm_medium=cpc&amp;utm_term=bpc%20flex%20spend%20account&amp;utm_content=5918456416&amp;utm_campaign=Partners_-__Phrase">BPC’s FSA Store web page</a>)</li>
<li>Day care for child or adult dependents </li></ul>
<p>On average, a Flexible Spending Account can save participants 15% - 25% from what they would normally pay because the FSA reduces how much you have to pay in taxes. The maximum employee contributions are $2,600 per year for Health FSA, and $5,000 for Dependent Spending Account. The Department of Treasury has modified its “use-it-or-lose-it&quot; provision to allow participants to roll over up to $500 of unused funds from one plan year to the next.</p>
<p style="color:darkblue"><strong>Life, Accidental Death &amp; Dismemberment (AD&amp;D) Insurance</strong></p>
<p>The benefit’s basic coverage--two times your annual salary up to $200,000-- is provided at no cost to full-time employees. </p>
<ul><li>Additional life and AD&amp;D insurance may be purchased for the employee, spouse and/or dependent children up to age 19 (23 years if a full-time student)</li>
<li>Rates are based on age and benefit amount</li>
<li>The online enrollment through e-Benefits will calculate costs for you</li>
<li>Enrollment is during initial hire, open enrollment, or due to a qualifying event</li></ul>
<p style="color:darkblue"><strong>Long-Term Disability Insurance</strong></p>
<p>This benefit helps replace a portion of a full-time employee’s income if he/she becomes disabled due to an illness or injury. Two options are available:</p>
<ul><li>Option A – Pays the employee 50% of monthly base earnings up to $5,000 after a 180-day elimination period. The college pays the entire cost of this option</li>
<li>Option B – The benefit pays the employee 66 2/3% of monthly base earnings up to $5,000 after a 90-day elimination period. The employee pays the premium cost, based on salary, for this upgrade.</li>
<li>Use the online enrollment through e-Benefits to calculate the costs for you</li></ul>
<p style="color:darkblue"><strong>Tuition Reimbursement &amp; Reduction Program</strong></p>
<p>Full-time employees may receive reimbursement for tuition/course costs of other colleges and universities to aid in their professional development.</p>
<ul><li>Approved courses that meet the guidelines as indicated in the Employee’s Personnel Policy and Procedures Handbook</li>
<li>Maximum reimbursement per fiscal year is $1,975 or 12 semester hours credit ,whichever is less</li>
<li>Full-time employees and their dependents (spouse &amp; dependent children) may register for any credit courses offered by KCC at “no cost” for tuition and certain fees</li>
<li>Maximum of two classes or eight semester hours, whichever is greater, per semester for employees</li>
<li>Number of credit hours in which a dependent may enroll is limited by student enrollment policies</li>
<li>Dependents are responsible for other related costs such as fees and textbooks</li></ul>
<p>Human Resources is looking forward to your attendance and encourages you to share any benefit-related questions. The morning and afternoon sessions (10-11:30 a.m. and 1-2:30 p.m. in the Iroquois room) will cover the same information in each and will be in an informal, open forum format. Representatives from AFLAC, BPC and SUAA also will be available. Lunch will be from 11:30-1 p.m.</p>
<p>NOTE: Open enrollment is Nov. 7 to Nov. 23, 2016. To increase early participation, there will be a drawing to win one of several $25 Walmart gift cards. To be entered, enroll in your benefits online by midnight on Sunday, Nov. 20. The drawing will be on Wednesday, Nov. 23, in time for Black Friday shopping! </p>
