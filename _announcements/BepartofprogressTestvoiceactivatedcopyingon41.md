<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassFC0B83F6549244DDB977DFA2623304A5"><p>​KCC will test voice-activated copy capabilities on Wednesday, April 1.</p>
<p>To help with the test project, visit any KCC copy machine at 4:01 p.m. Wednesday April 1. Bring a sheet of white paper with a hand-drawn calendar showing April 2015. Have the date, April 1, circled. Use either the manual feed or the glass. </p>
<p>Put the calendar on the machine and test it by saying the magic words: &quot;Magic Words.&quot; Do not touch the copier, other than to put the paper on it. If the machine does not spring to life, try saying the magic words a little louder. The goal is to print 41 copies.</p>
<p>The test will end within a minute, so all attempts must be made at 4:01 p.m. All participants should report results – whether the copying works or not – to Stephen Dockemeyer in the Marketing Department. Stephen will only accept results on April 1.</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for assisting in this important step toward a copy utopia at KCC!<br /></p>
