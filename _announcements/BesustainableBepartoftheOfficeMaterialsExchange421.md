<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassA8EA4075490D4142A60EB10C2F97C327><div><strong><font size=2>From Rich Schultz, coordinator of the Sustainability Center Sustainability and Planning</font></strong></div>
<div><br><font size=2>We all have items we no longer use stashed here or there in our homes.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>Work areas are no different. Some office supplies (paper clips, manila file folders, hanging files, binder clips, rubber bands, page dividers, etc.) go unused. Others, we have an abundant supply. Many of these items may be useful to others on campus. We can make them available to those who will use them.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>In most cases these items can be used and reused many times before they are ready for the trash. Unfortunately, many supplies are thrown away and new supplies are ordered elsewhere at KCC. Let’s try to break this wasteful cycle! </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>As part of this year’s Sustainability Week activities, I am proposing that we have an “Office Materials Exchange.” <br>Unused items will be collected and placed in a central location. On Thursday, April 21 faculty and staff will have the opportunity to look over the collection and take whatever they can use. There are some stipulations: the items are to be used for KCC business and whoever takes the items must plan to actually use them! </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>It would be a sort of office supplies “garage sale.”</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>This idea has worked with great success at other schools. McHenry County College has done it for the last five years and the staff look forward to it. It saves resources, it saves money, and it’s sustainable. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>I would like to know everyone’s thoughts about this idea. In order for it to work, people need to step forward and be part of the effort! You know where these unused items are in your offices and work areas. I will coordinate the effort, but need help getting unused items from your area to the central location. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>Who is willing to help make this a successful event? To take part, please contact me at 815-802-8243 or at </font><a href="mailto:rschultz@kcc.edu"><font size=2>rschultz@kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2>. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>Thanks for your consideration!<br></font></div></div></div>
