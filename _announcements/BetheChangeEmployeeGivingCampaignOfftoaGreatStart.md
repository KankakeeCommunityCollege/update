<div><br />The 2012 employee giving campaign, “Be the Change,” is off to a great start! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The campaign kicked-off last Thursday and more than $4,000 had been raised as of Friday, Aug. 24. </div>
<div><br />The goal for this year’s campaign is 100 percent participation. Every gift is important, regardless of size.</div>
<div><br />“In 2011, the college’s top administrators were asked to participate in an Employee Giving Campaign,&quot; said Kelly Myers, executive director of the KCC Foundation. &quot;Twenty-five administrators gave nearly $20,000. Their leadership sets the pace for this campaign. The amount of the gift doesn’t matter. The participation of our employees sends a strong message to our students and the community. It says that we are willing to invest in KCC.”</div>
<div><br />All employees who donate to the campaign are invited to a celebration reception from 5-7 p.m. Thursday, Aug. 30 at The Fieldhouse on Heritage, 12 Heritage Plaza in Bourbonnais. It is near Convent/Route 45, turn left on John Casey Drive.  Hors d’ouerves will be available. Participants also will receive a “Be the Change” T-shirt.</div>
<div><br /><font color="#000080"><strong>It’s not too late!</strong></font></div>
<div><br />The open enrollment period for “Be the Change” runs through Thursday, Aug. 30. However, employees are still able to sign up at any time. To learn more about the “Be the Change” campaign, check out the <a href="http://youtu.be/ls4z1f4wmSk">campaign video</a>.</div>
