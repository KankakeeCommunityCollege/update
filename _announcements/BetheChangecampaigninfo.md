<p><font color="#333399">Submitted by Kelly Myers, executive director of The KCC Foundation</font></p>
<p>In August, we asked KCC faculty, staff, administration and retirees to participate in a campaign that would benefit our students.<br /> <br />To date, we have raised $18,579. Thank you to those who have contributed! You have invested in our students, our college and our community! <br /> <br />The campaign offers four funds to choose from: Student Success and Leadership Fund, Program Excellence Fund, Emerging Needs and College Improvement Fund. More information is on the <a href="/Foundation/giving/eg/Pages/default.aspx">Be the Change website</a>. Also, it is worth mentioning that some contributors inquired about other giving opportunities, and these requests have been honored when the request can be allocated properly. Feel free to ask me about all of the main Foundation funds and other giving options.<br /> <br />If you have not already supported “Be the Change,” there is still time. The campaign will extend through June 30, 2013. Then, a new annual campaign will begin in August 2013. <br /></p></div></div>
