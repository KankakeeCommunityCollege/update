<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassE390EA3853244EEE96CAE4206271A1CB><div><font size=2>The longest-serving current member of the Kankakee Community Board of Trustees has been honored by the Illinois Community College Trustees Association.<br>Betty Meents of Watseka was presented with the 35-year Trustee Award from the Illinois Community College Trustees Association during the ICCTA annual convention and Board of Representatives meeting. The event was June 3 in Bloomington.<br>Meents joined the KCC board of trustees in April 1976.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>“Friends urged me to run (for the board) because I am from Iroquois County,” Meents said. “The board has always tried to have representation from the various areas in the KCC district. I am so happy that I did. I thought it was a great way to be of service to the taxpayers in the KCC district.</div>
<div><br>“My proudest moments have been sitting on the stage and watching the students accept their their diplomas on graduation day. Seeing the smiles of accomplishment on their faces and hearing the cheers from family and friends is rewarding. </div>
<div><br>“I feel so many students are able to attend KCC because of the low tuition and because of the many Foundation scholarships and grants which are available. The community college system enhances the lives of so many. I take pride in serving on the KCC board.</div>
<div><br>“It is indeed a very rewarding experience. I have enjoyed working with the board of trustees and the great minds of four presidents (Dr. L.H. Horton, Dr. Larry Huffman, Dr. Jerry Weber and Dr. John Avendano). Our KCC faculty and staff are superb as well. My 35 years have been very satisfying.”<br>Other trustees who were honored for 35 years of service were Dr. Robert Ehrich, a trustee at Illinois Central College in East Peoria and Robert Wunderlich, a trustee at Joliet Junior College.</div>
<div><br>Two KCC faculty members and an alumnus also were nominated for ICCTA awards. </div>
<div><br>Kristine Condon was nominated for the ICCTA Outstanding Full-Time Faculty Award. Condon is a professor for the Office of Continuing Education and Career Services and the KCC Business and Technology Division. She also is coordinator of the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program.</div>
<div><br>Dana Meyer was nominated for the ICCTA Outstanding Part-Time Faculty Award. Meyer, a partner in the law firm of Ackman, Marek, Meyer, Tebo &amp; Coghlan, Ltd., in Kankakee, teaches part-time for the KCC Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies Program.</div>
<div><br>Dominic Surprenant was nominated for the ICCTA Distinguished Alumnus Award. A 1977 KCC graduate, Surprenant went on to graduate cum laude from Harvard Law School in 1985. He is currently a senior partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan LLP, the largest litigation-only law firm in the U.S.<br></div></font></div></div>
