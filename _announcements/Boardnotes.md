<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass547153715D6B4A09A317F38EC93DC01E><div>The following items are highlighted from the board of trustees agenda, Dec. 13, 2010:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>December meeting guests<br></strong>The board met Phi Theta Kappa officers Michael Nemeth, Rebecca Hoffman and Stephen Hoctor and learned more about the club's activities. Currently, Phi Theta Kappa members continue to tutor GED and Adult Basic Education students, and they are working on a clothing and winter coat drive. </div>
<div><br><strong>President's report<br></strong>President John Avendano gave a brief report to the board about the Higher Learning Commission forum in November, the Great Expectations retreat, tobacco revenue bonds, his visits to area high schools, community college support for veterans, community responses to northern extension site survey, the Student Advisory Council leadership breakfast and the White Christmas event. </div>
<div><br><strong>Child safety policy<br></strong>The board conducted a final reading and accepted a policy for the safety and well-being of children on campus. The policy was developed after faculty and staff voiced concerns about the safety of unattended children in classrooms, the LRC and other common areas. The adopted policy follows: <br>To ensure the safety and well-being of its patrons, children are not permitted in classes, testing, computer, or tutoring labs or employee work areas at any time. Also, for safety reasons, children under the age of 14 years cannot be left unattended at any time. This includes KCC campus property and vehicles, satellite centers, employee work areas, or at any college event. </div>
<div><br>In the event a child under the age of 14 years is left unattended, KCC employees will notify campus security and the dean of student development to locate the parent and document the incident. Every effort will be made to locate the parents or guardian before contacting the Department of Children and Family Services (DCFS). </div>
<div><br>This policy applies to children of students, employees and community members. </div>
<div><br><strong>Computer purchase<br></strong>The board approved the request to purchase computers from Dell Direct. <br></div></div></div>
