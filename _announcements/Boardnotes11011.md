<div>Following is a summary of topics addressed at KCC's board of trustees meeting held Monday, Jan. 10, 2011. <br></div>
<div><font size=3><strong>Heating, ventilation and air conditioning renovation, phase II<br></strong></font>The board approved the request to bid services for phase II of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning renovation. The work will take place this summer and will include L Building areas from the Atrium to food service on all three floors. It will not include the east wing. More information will be shared as it becomes available. </div>
<div><br><strong><font size=3>Wind tower<br></font></strong>The board approved the award of a bid for a 100 foot, 50 kilowatt wind tower. The tower will be purchased with grant funds from the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation and the U.S. Department of Education. It's anticipated that it will be constructed south of the parking lots, and it may be completed by late April. The electricity that is produced will be harnessed for college use. Students also will use the tower for instructional purposes and simulate maintenance and repairs as part of the Electrical Technology curriculum. </div>
<div><br><strong><font size=3>President's Report<br></font></strong>Dr. Avendano gave a brief report to the board about the following topics:</div>
<div><br><strong>Preliminary spring semester enrollment: </strong>totals are up 4 percent for headcount and 3.5 percent for credit hours.<br>KCC's men's and women's basketball teams are undefeated: KCC, Amhurst and Duke are the only three schools in the nation with undefeated records for both men's and women's basketball teams. </div>
<div><br><strong>State support:</strong> 100 percent of state support arrived for fiscal year 2010, but the state is slow with its fiscal year 2011 payments. To date, the college has received 1/12 of its fiscal year 2011 monies. </div>
<div><br><strong>Newly elected officials have been invited to tour campus: </strong>U.S. Rep. Adam Kinzinger visited in December.</div>
<div><br><strong><font size=3>Additional approvals<br></font></strong>The board approved tuition and course reimbursements, and chargebacks.<br></div></div></div>
