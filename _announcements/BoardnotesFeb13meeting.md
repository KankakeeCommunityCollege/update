<div>Following is a summary of topics addressed at KCC’s Board of Trustees meeting held Monday, Feb. 13, 2012.</div>
<div><br><font color="#0000ff">Mission, vision, core values and philosophy<br></font>The Board reaffirmed its approval of the college’s mission, vision, core values and philosophy statements. The reaffirmation is important for accrediting processes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><font color="#0000ff">Tuition increase<br></font>The board approved a recommendation to increase tuition by $3 to $100 per credit hour and fees by $3 to $13. The total tuition and fee rate will be $113, effective for the Summer 2012 term. With this increase, it is anticipated that KCC tuition and fees will be near the state average for community colleges for next year. The average KCC student enrolls for nine credit hours and would incur an additional $54 per semester at the new rate. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><font color="#0000ff">Bond issue <br></font>The board took the final step in approving a $3 million funding bond. Proceeds from the bonds will be used for equipment, infrastructure improvements, institutional technology projects and other capital projects.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><font color="#0000ff">10th day enrollment<br></font>Tenth-day enrollment numbers for Spring 2012 decreased compared to Spring 2011. Headcount totals went down 4.7 percent, and credit hours decreased 5 percent.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><font color="#0000ff">North Extension Center<br></font>Demonica Kemper Architects presented the Board with preliminary designs for a new facility at the North Extension Center in Bradley. The board approved the recommendation for the architects to prepare final drawings for the project. It’s anticipated that the North Extension Center may be ready for classes beginning fall 2014.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div><font color="#0000ff">Energy conservation grant<br></font>The board heard a report about the Illinois Green Economy Network (IGEN) grant through the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. IGEN is purchasing energy-efficient lighting for participating colleges. This will allow KCC to replace all T-12 fluorescent light fixtures, add motion sensors, install LED emergency exit signs on west campus, and install classroom lights and sensors throughout the third floor of the main campus L building. These items will provide more efficient lighting, save energy and increase the quality of light. A similar project was completed for the gymnasium in 2010. </div>
<div><br><font color="#0000ff">Approvals of reimbursements, purchases and fees</font></div>
<div>The board approved tuition reimbursements; a request to purchase computers from Dell Direct for staff offices and lab computer systems upgrades; and course fees effective Summer 2012.<br></div></div></div>
