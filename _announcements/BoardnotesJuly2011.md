<div>Following is a summary of topics addressed at KCC’s board of trustees meeting, held Monday, July 11.</div>
<div><br /><strong><font color="#000080">Flag presentation<br /></font></strong>U.S. Army Private First Class Alan Whitcomb presented the board with an American flag that was flown in Afghanistan on July 4, 2009. Whitcomb served six years in the U.S. Army National Guard, including one year overseas, and received the flag from his commanding officer in honor of his &quot;dedication, commitment and noble support&quot; during the global war on terrorism. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The flag will be displayed in a traditional three-sided case in KCC’s Wall of Honor, and it will be unfurled and flown at KCC on Memorial Day, July 4, Veterans Day and Sept. 11 each year. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Whitcomb is a student in the Criminal Justice program, and he also worked as a member of the security team at KCC for one year. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><font color="#000080">10th-day enrollment report <br /></font></strong>This semester’s enrollment report follows two years of historic enrollment highs for the college, as Summer 2009 and 2010 saw headcount increases of nearly 17 percent and 32 percent. Overall, Summer 2011 enrollment numbers decreased 10.85 percent in headcount to 2,407 students and 12.74 percent in credit hours to 11,642 credit hours as compared to 2010. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong><font color="#000080">Board member recognition plan<br /></font></strong>The administration presented a recognition plan for trustees as they retire from their terms of service.
