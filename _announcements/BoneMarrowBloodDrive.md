<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass990E678917674027AFFA024BE7E9BF71"><p>​Kankakee Community College is hosting bone marrow and blood drives on Wednesday, Dec. 3 from 9:30 a.m. - 1:30 p.m. in the Cavalier and Iroquois Rooms at KCC.<br /><br />At the bone marrow drive, potential donors will have a cotton swab cheek specimen collected for testing and possible placement on the national registry of bone marrow donors. Volunteers must be between the ages of 18 to 44, and in good general health. No appointments are necessary.<br /><br />Each donor is asked to give a minimum of $1 to offset the cost of the bone marrow drive. <br /><br />Bone marrow transplants are used to treat leukemia, aplastic anemia and many other life-threatening blood diseases. If an exact match is found between a registered donor and a person in need of a bone marrow transplant, the potential donor is contacted to discuss options before the donation.<br /><br />The American Red Cross Blood Drive will be open to new and returning donors over age 17. Repeat donors must have at least 56 days since their last whole blood donation or 112 days since their last double red cell donation. Other qualifications for all donors are to be in good general health, feeling well, and weigh at least 110 pounds.<br /><br />The Red Cross is in serious need of eligible donors, especially those with O-negative type blood. In most cases, the entire donation process takes about one hour. <br /><br />The bone marrow drive is being sponsored by KCC’s chapter of Phi Theta Kappa, the international honor society for community college students. The blood drive is sponsored by KCC’s Office of Student Life.<br /><br />To schedule an appointment for the blood drive phone 815-802-8100, walk-ins are also welcome.</p>
