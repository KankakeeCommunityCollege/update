<p>A KCC alumna, and former employee, Bonnie (Jepson) Gregg was diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, or Lou Gehrig’s Disease) in April of 2016 at the age of 46. </p>
<p>This debilitating disease affects the nervous system and she has since lost most of her mobility, and is unable to walk or use her hands. Most devastatingly, her ability to speak has also been taken. Although difficult at times, Bonnie has maintained her spirit and sense of humor.</p>
<p>Despite the challenges of the disease itself, there are many other challenges that Bonnie and her husband, Evan, face -- including financial burdens. Evan is an adult probation officer for Kankakee County and an adjunct professor at KCC, teaching Criminal Justice courses. Although they have insurance, not everything is covered. The consumables Bonnie needs for tube-feeding and bi-pap breathing machine alone are enormous. They will continue to increase as the disease progresses.</p>
<p><img alt="bowl-for-Bonnie.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/bowl-for-Bonnie.jpg" style="margin:5px" /><br />Bonnie’s family and friends are hosting a benefit on Saturday, Nov. 4, 2017 at the <a href="http://brookmontbowlingcenter.com/">Brookmont Bowling Center</a> from 4-8 p.m. to help raise funds to assist Bonnie and Evan.

Tickets also will be available at the door. Please see the <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Bowling-Bonnie.pdf">attached flier</a> for more details. </p>
<p>Donations also can be made to:<br />Bonnie Gregg Benefit<br />c/o Farmers State Bank<br />3308 Waldron Road<br />Aroma Park IL 60901</p>
<p>Please come out and support one of KCC’s family members!</p></div></div>
