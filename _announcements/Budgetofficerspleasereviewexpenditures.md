<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE17155D24C5C45228EF4ADB6F73AF00A"><p>​The Accounting Office and Business Office would like to remind all budget officers to review their expenditures against their departmental budgets. </p>
<p>&quot;Since we are almost complete with this fiscal year, now is a great time to prepare budget transfer requests to cover any amounts overspent to ensure you do not exceed your allocated budget for FY16,&quot; said Beth Nunley, director of financial affairs. &quot;Thank you in advance!&quot;</p>
<p>Please contact Beth at 815-802-8142 or Brenda Dressler at 815-802-8135 for further information.</p></div></div>
