<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass6FBB9E1474214936A620B517756F659A><div><font size=2>     The media department has a procedure in place when photos and prints of photos are requested.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    The department will loan a Canon digital camera to those who would like photos taken of college events and program activities. The camera will be loaned out after being reserved and on a first-come, first-served basis.</div>
<div><br>    In order to borrow the camera, the person making the request completes a camera sign-out form--including the date and time when it will be returned.</div>
<div><br>    Media personnel also can loan a card reader to download and store the photos, or will make a CD of the photos. These options are available upon request.</div>
<div><br>Photos for press releases, news articles and collegewide marketing materials will still be taken by media personnel. The same guidelines as in the past for scheduling those appointments still apply.</div>
<div><br>    The camera usage policy and other information about marketing and promotions are available on the Public Relations and Graphic Design page on the website.</div>
<div><br>    For more information, contact Kari Sargeant, director of marketing and public relations at 815-802-8256 or e-mail her; or Ellen Skelly, coordinator of publications at 815-802-8256 or email her.  </font></div>
