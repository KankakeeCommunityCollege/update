<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass3E5D0F6202AE44F49E28BCF24BFECBAF"><p>​Currently enrolled students will receive non-emergency text messages this fall for the first time. The text messages are part of the Enrollment Management Team’s communications plan. </p>
<p>“We know students expect us to reach them on their mobile devices,” said Kari Nugent, director of Marketing and Public Relations. “We will send retention messages, reminders about registration, payment options, tutoring and more. It’s also a way to connect, deliver words of encouragement and keep students engaged.” </p>
