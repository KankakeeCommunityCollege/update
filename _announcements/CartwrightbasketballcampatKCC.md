<div><font size="2">Former Chicago Bulls player and Coach Bill Cartwright will lead a co-ed basketball camp at Kankakee Community College from June 10 to 13.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />“We’re going to learn how to work together,” Cartwright said. “It doesn’t matter how great you are individually because basketball is a team sport. So we learn how to play team basketball. We learn how to build ourselves up individually and have some fun.</div>
<div><br />“What happens in basketball now is that players try to dictate the action and what you will learn here is that the ball dictates the action. So it’s just like life, the more you move the ball the more you will get it back and in a better position to score.”</div>
<div><br />The Bill Cartwright Basketball Camp of Champions is open to boys and girls entering fourth through 12th grades. Camp meets Tuesday through Friday, June 10 to 13, from 9 a.m. - 3 p.m. each day in the KCC Ryan Gymnasium. At the end of camp, players will get a camp T-shirt plus a picture with Cartwright and a signed autograph from him.</div>

The 7-foot-1 Cartwright also played for the New York Knicks and the Seattle Supersonics. He was an assistant &amp; head coach for Chicago Bulls, Assistant Coach for New Jersey Nets &amp; Phoenix Suns.</div>
<div><br />Cartwright's son, Justin, also will be a camp instructor, along with KCC's basketball coaches, Julian Springer and Donnie Denson. Justin Cartwright is head coach of Chicagoland Jewish High School Girls Basketball. Other coaches are to be announced.</div>
