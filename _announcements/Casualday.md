<div><font size=2>The following dates will be casual days: Dec. 17, 20 and 21, and Jan. 7. <br><br>As a reminder, casual day guidelines are: <br><br>-- Participation is optional. <br><br>-- Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public information. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information. <br><br>-- Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded. <br><br>-- Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire. <br><br>-- All employee groups can participate. <br><br>-- Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college. <br><br>Questions regarding casual days should be directed to Vicki Gardner, vice president for finance and administration.<br></font></div></div></div>
