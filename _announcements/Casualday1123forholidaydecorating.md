<div><font color="#003366"><strong>Several casual days are coming up<br /></strong></font></div>
<div>The following dates will be casual days: Nov. 23, Dec. 19, 20, 21, and Jan. 6. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Nov. 23 casual day is for those who are decorating for the holidays. See the related article about <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Lists/Announcements/DispForm2.aspx?List=7e45450e-520d-4ad3-81dd-a79ebcc75df4&amp;ID=519&amp;Source=http%3a//www.kcc.edu/FacultyStaff/update/Pages/dailyupdate.aspx">holiday decoration delivery from storage</a>.</div>
<div><br />As a reminder, casual day guidelines are: </div>
<div><br />-- Participation is optional. </div>
<div><br />-- Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public information. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information. </div>
<div><br />-- Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded. </div>
<div><br />-- Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire. </div>
<div><br />-- All employee groups can participate. </div>
<div><br />-- Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college. </div>
<div><br />Questions regarding casual days should be directed to Vicki Gardner, vice president for finance and administration.</div>
