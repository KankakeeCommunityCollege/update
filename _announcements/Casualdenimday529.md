<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassB8139D0661884677A7E527DD1F4B6D94"><p>â€‹Because it is a Friday when classes are not being held, on May 29, employees will have the option to follow the casual day guidelines. </p>
<p style="color:blue"><strong>Casual day guidelines are:</strong></p>
<ul><li>Participation is optional.</li>
<li>Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public relations. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information.</li>
<li>Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded.</li>
<li>Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire.</li>
<li>All employee groups can participate.</li>
<li>Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college.</li></ul>
<p>Questions regarding casual days should be directed to David Cagle, director of human resources.<br /></p>
