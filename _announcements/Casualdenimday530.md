<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass33159F09B16B4394B398F5FD10169261"><div>Because it is a Friday when classes are not being held, on May 30, employees will have the option to follow the casual day guidelines.
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Casual day guidelines are:</div>
<div><br />-- Participation is optional.</div>
<div><br />-- Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public relations. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information.</div>
<div><br />-- Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded.</div>
<div><br />-- Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire.</div>
<div><br />-- All employee groups can participate.</div>
<div><br />-- Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college.<br /></div>
<div></div>
<div>Questions regarding casual days should be directed to Vicki Gardner, vice president for finance and administration.</div>
