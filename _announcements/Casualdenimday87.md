<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassCC85AA62BF1C4026A678E77231DABC54"><p>​Because it is a Friday when classes are not being held, employees will have the option to follow the casual day guidelines on Aug. 7. </p>
<p>Casual day guidelines are:<br />-- Participation is optional.<br />-- Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public relations. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information.<br />-- Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded.<br />-- Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire.<br />-- All employee groups can participate.<br />-- Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college.<br />Questions regarding casual days should be directed to Vicki Gardner, vice president for finance and administration.</p>
<p>Note: Due its proximity to the new semester, Aug. 14 will not be a casual day.</p>
