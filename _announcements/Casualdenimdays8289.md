<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC24235D3961D4CBDA95B9F8F88D7A1C7">
<div><br />Because they are Fridays when classes are not being held, on Aug. 2 and Aug. 9, employees will have the option to follow the casual day guidelines.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Casual day guidelines are:<br />-- Participation is optional.<br />-- Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public relations. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information.<br />-- Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded.<br />-- Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire.<br />-- All employee groups can participate.<br />-- Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college.<br /></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Questions regarding casual days should be directed to Vicki Gardner, vice president for finance and administration.</div>
<div><br />Note: Due to its proximity to the new semester, Aug. 16 will not be a casual day.</div>
