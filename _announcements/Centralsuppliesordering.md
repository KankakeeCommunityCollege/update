<p>The Hammes Bookstore staff is heading into our busy time with buyback starting Monday, Dec. 7 and running through Monday, Dec. 14. We will make every effort to deliver orders as time allows and before we leave for winter break. Please also keep in mind that once we return in January we will be busy with book sales so delivery of central supply orders could be delayed 2-3 weeks.</p>
<p>Thank for your patience, and sorry for any inconvenience.<br /></p></div></div>
