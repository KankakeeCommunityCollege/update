<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass9E063A36B5CE4E02A8DDA9C5E26C18D5"><p>​The Accounting Office has changed the deregistration process. Students who have not paid for classes will be deregistered on two dates – Dec. 4 and Jan. 26. </p>
<p>Before, the Accounting Office deregistered students every week leading up to 8-week classes.</p>
<p>Since the Accounting Office is running deregistration less frequently, students will not be automatically dropped for non-payment after Jan. 26. It is now the responsibility of students to drop a class by the refund date. Those who are still enrolled after the refund date are obligated to pay for the class. Students can review their registration statements for refund dates, or log into <a href="http://connect.kcc.edu/">KCConnect </a>and choose My Registration Statement. Dropping classes may affect financial aid and scholarships.</p>
<p>Questions about the new process can be directed to Michele Buikema in the Accounting Office at 815-802-8148 or <a href="mailto:mbuikema@kcc.edu">mbuikema@kcc.edu</a>.</p>
<p> Students can consult with the Financial Aid Office, advisors or accounting staff with questions. </p></div></div>
