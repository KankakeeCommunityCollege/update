<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE90AA4C265B841BDA1AA2740F1C977F4"><p>​The Accounting Office has changed the deregistration process.</p>
<p>It is now the responsibility of students to drop a class by the refund date. Those who are still enrolled on the refund date are obligated to pay for the class.</p>
<p>One change is that the Accounting Office will no longer deregister students every week leading up to when 8-week classes began.</p>
