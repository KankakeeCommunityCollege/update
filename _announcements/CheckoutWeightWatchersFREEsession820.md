<div><br />Well, you're invited to attend a Weight Watchers meeting for FREE on Wednesday, Aug. 20 from 12:15-12:45 p.m. in Room L253. Come meet Claire McElroy, our dynamic group leader, and see her in action!</div>
<div><br />So far this year, the KCC Weight Watchers group has lost more than 400 pounds. <br /></div>
<div>“You can eat whatever you want on the program. No special foods are required on the plan,” said Kari Nugent, a participant since 2009. “And, the group meetings are great! Everyone is supportive and cares about how the others are doing. Come to the open house and learn how this can fit for you, too.”</div>
<div><br />Meetings are typically held on Wednesdays from 12:15-12:45 p.m. in Room L279. The next series begins on Sept. 10. </div>
<div><br />For more information, please contact Kari at <a href="mailto:ksargeant@kcc.edu">ksargeant@kcc.edu</a> or 815-802-8256.</div>
