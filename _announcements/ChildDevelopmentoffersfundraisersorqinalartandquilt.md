<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE31EBFA2A6564F299575F4DB2FA2CD68"><p>​The Child Development Center is offering two fundraisers -- an art sale/reception and a quilt auction.</p>
<p>Sample artwork created by children at the center is on display all week in the display case outside the Child Development Center, on the first floor of the L Building.</p>
<p>The art will be for sale at the annual Art Reception on Friday, April 17 from 6-7:30 p.m. </p>
<p>The quilt features pieces created by children who attend the center. There are more than 25 children's squares on the quilt, which is being assembled by the grandmother of one of the children. Once complete, this one-of-a-kind quilt will be auctioned at the Art Reception.</p>
<p>The quilt will be on display as follows (pending its completion): Wednesday, April 15 - College Center; Thursday, April 16 - Child Development Display Case; Friday, April 17 - College Center then Art Reception. </p>
<p>All proceeds from the sale will benefit the project to build a Listening Center within the Child Development Center.</p>
<p>Also note: Artwork that does not get sold Friday will be available for purchase the following week. Contact <a href="mailto:nzeller@kcc.edu">Nancy Zeller</a> at 815-802-8506 for information.<br /></p>
