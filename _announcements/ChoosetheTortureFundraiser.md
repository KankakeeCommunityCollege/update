<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass9E3C55B054F4467EB7726D5867DD6E84"><p>​Employees are asked to tell students about this event. Following is the description provided by the Office of Student Life:<br /><br />&quot;The Student Advisory Council is sponsoring the “Choose the Torture” fundraiser in honor of Austin Barnett. Austin is a ten-year old Limestone Elementary student battling cancer. His full story can be found at: http://www.daily-journal.com/news/local/limestone-boy-fighting-cancer-again/article_8c7e2f5c-3970-54c4-93ea-1678c89c7406.html . <br /><br />KCC Student Advisory Council members will be collecting donations at various times in the College Center beginning Monday, April 6 – Friday, May 1. Staff, faculty, and students can donate to one of three tortures: dress like a Cavalier, ice bucket challenge, or eat bad jelly beans. The torture that earns the most money will determine how KCC President, Dr. Avendano will suffer! His torture day will be on Thursday, May 7 at 2 p.m. on the North Patio. <br /><br />All proceeds will be donated to Austin Barnett and his family. <br />The community is invited to participate. Donations can be made out to Kankakee Community College and mailed to:<br /><br />Attn: Student Activities (A.B. Fund)<br />Kankakee Community College<br />100 College Drive<br />Kankakee, IL 60901&quot;</p>
