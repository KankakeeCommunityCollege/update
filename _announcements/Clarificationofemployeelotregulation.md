<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass995806E0EF7E409B837598E6E2787AE5"><p>​The college police department would like to remind everyone that employee parking areas are for when the employee is working. In other words, if an employee is not at work, his/her vehicle should not be in the employee parking lot -- even if it was driven to the college by a relative or friend.</p>
