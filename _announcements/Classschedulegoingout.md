<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass5530E15627F845A8BF23CE93051C5283><div><font size=2>    At the end of this month, the Office of Marketing and Public Relations will send the Fall 2011 class schedule to the printer to arrive on campus by July 15.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>     In order to assure the accuracy of the contents of the course listings, all faculty and associate deans are invited to look over the pages. This is a chance to check for accuracy of class times, dates, locations, titles, etc. but not to alter what is being offered or to add or delete sections. <br></div>
<div>     Anyone who would like to make this final check can visit Sharon Hoogstraat's desk, 1-3 p.m. on June 20 and 9 a.m. - noon on June 21. If that time frame does not work, call Sharon at 815-802-8509 to set up a time.</font></div>
