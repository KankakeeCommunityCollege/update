<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassEE86B323D83847E2B0FEE41498386486><div>At the end of this month, the Office of Marketing and Public Relations will send the Fall 2011 class schedule to the printer to arrive on campus by July 15.<br>    </div>
<div>In order to assure the accuracy of the contents of the course listings, all faculty and division chairs are invited to look over the pages. This is a chance to check for accuracy of class times, dates, locations, titles, etc. but not to alter what is being offered or to add or delete sections. <br>    </div>
<div>Anyone who would like to make this final check can visit Sharon Hoogstraat's desk, 1-3 p.m. on June 20 and 9 a.m. - noon on June 21. If that time frame does not work, call Sharon at 815-802-8509 to set up a time.<br></div></div></div>
