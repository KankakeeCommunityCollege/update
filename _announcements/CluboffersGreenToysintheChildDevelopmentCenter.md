<div> </div>
<div>Many of us have young children of our own, or grandkids, nieces, nephews, etc. to whom we like to give toys from time to time. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If we could provide them with toys which are safe, environmentally friendly, and made in the U.S.A., why wouldn’t we? Well, read on!</div>
<div><br />The newly formed Students for Eco Quality club received a donation of several toys manufactured by “Green Toys, Inc.”  from a generous faculty member. The original plan was to raffle them off as a fundraiser for the new club, but they had a better idea. Club members decided to donate the toys to the KCC Child Development Center as a way to promote Sustainability!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Shown in the pictures above are some of the kids as they received the toys from members of the Eco Quality Club on Wednesday, May 22. </div>
<div><br />These toys are truly “green,” made from recycled milk jugs (High Density Polyethylene – HDPE) by American workers in a facility in California. The plastic is recycled into useful products which are subject to U.S. quality control and safety standards. They aren’t shipped from an overseas factory, thus avoiding the enormous carbon footprint associated with transporting things such long distances. Seems like a winner to me! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are several different “green” toys available as well as other useful things, like dishwasher safe children’s tableware. Green Toys, Inc. is based in California and its products are available for <a href="http://www.greentoys.com/">online purchase</a> or from an extensive list of retail stores.</div>
