<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass368636338DBC4E36B8FC04B05C540AD4"><p>Following the recognition program on Friday, Nov. 14, a black men's wool overcoat was left behind. The coat is size 48R, and it is from London Fog.</p>
<p>The same night, another man attending the event was missing his black men's wool overcoat and gloves.</p>
<p>All people who attended the recognition program are asked to check to see if the wrong coat was accidentally brought home.</p>
<p>If a black overcoat is brought in, it can be immediately swapped with the London Fog coat which was found. Please contact Linda Chouinard or Laurel Soper in the Marketing Department, Room L270, to make the exchange. </p>
<p>Thank you for your help!<br /><br /><br /><br />***<br /><br /><a href="/update">Go to Online Update</a><br /> <br /></p></div></div>
