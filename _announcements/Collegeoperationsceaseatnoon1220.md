<div>Â </div>
<div>All areas of the college will cease operations at noon on Thursday, Dec. 20.</div>
<div><br>This will allow employees to gather for the entire Holiday Buffet celebration. Following the luncheon, all employees are invited to use the remaining afternoon hours to take down holiday decorations and prepare for the new year. </div>
<div><br>Perhaps there are some old files to clear, or an area that needs special attention. The afternoon will be available to catch up on such matters before the winter break.</div>
<div><br>Happy holidays to all!</div></div></div>
