<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass2CBC77382A5A495D9EC376DE9C292015"><p>​Before the end of July, the KCC website will debut an online newsroom and a new look for the <em>Update</em> employee newsletter.</p>
<p>The online newsroom will replace the current lists of events and announcements on the home page. It will have a featured video from the KCC YouTube page, recent announcements  and upcoming events. Stories with photos will have links to full-size pictures. </p>
<p>The main newsroom page will have &quot;today's events&quot; and a link to a calendar with all posted events. There will be links to class cancellations, the academic calendar, game schedules, student club events, TLC workshops and <em>Update</em>.</p>
<p><em>Update</em> will also have a new look. </p>
<p>Announcements and events will be side-by-side. Events will have the most noticeable differences. </p>
<p>After a short list of the events which start soonest, there will be a link to all events. Plus, there will be a new event category, &quot;community events,&quot; with events open to community members and/or students. It will mirror the events listed on the news center site. </p>
<p>Articles for both for the online newsroom and Update will continue to be published as they are ready.</p>
