<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassF7C9BFDA062049E0AA22B021BDA89C25><div>  <font size=2>   Members of the Supportive Staff Communications Committee have been discussing KCC's Core Values and what they mean to them. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    Below are comments regarding &quot;collaboration&quot; which were shared at a recent meeting. They are being shared with the KCC Community as a whole to help all of us continue to focus on what we are all about.</div>
<div><br>     In coming weeks, other comments regarding &quot;learning&quot; and &quot;respect&quot; will be shared.</div>
<div></font> </div>
<div><font size=2>Collaboration<br>    &quot;Collaboration should no longer convey a negative meaning as it did after the second World War, where the word referred to persons or groups who helped a foreign occupier of their country. Linguistically, &quot;collaboration&quot; implies more or less equal partners who work together--which is obviously not the case when one party is an occupier and the other party is being occupied.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    Too often, when we are asked to collaborate on a project or idea involving a specific department, the members of that department might feel &quot;intruded upon&quot; or &quot;inefficient in their duties.&quot;</div>
<div><br>    Too often, when we are asked to collaborate on a project, we are overwhelmed by the sheer thought that we might be ridiculed or even worse, our ideas and/or knowledge ignored by the team.</div>
<div><br>    In either instance, these &quot;feelings and thoughts&quot; should not be the case. What must be remembered and stressed before, during and after all collaborative ventures is that the team can obtain greater resources, recognition and reward with and for their efforts.</div>
<div><br>    In most instances, the reason we are called to collaborate with a department or other individual is to share information, ideas, creativity and knowledge, thus expanding our capacity to create a trust and support system for problem solving and practical help both now and in the future.</div>
<div><br>    Collaboration is a way of coordinating different ideas from numerous people to generate a wide variety of knowledge. Collaboration requires two or more individuals voluntarily bringing their knowledge and experience together by interacting in the best interest possible towards reaching a common goal. </div>
<div><br>    I believe most collaborative ventures require fairly strong leadership, with that leadership encouraging participation by even the quietest member. I have found that sometimes, it is the quiet ones who have the most valuable input ... but they were just too overwhelmed to open up or felt too &quot;new&quot; to contribute any input.</div>
<div><br>    I believe collaboration should be an on-going behavior. I stress the word behavior. Every time we ask a question of a co-worker, we are collaborating on reaching a specific outcome. Every meeting we attend is a collaboration of minds that have been formulated (for good or for worse) by their upbringing, beliefs, environment, position at the institution, and current mind set. </div>
<div><br>    I firmly believe this core value is the foundation of all the core values the college has written into policy. I believe that without sincere and effective collaboration two other core values are strictly words in writing only: Integrity and Respect. If we cannot effectively collaborate on ideas, projects or events by listening and considering even the smallest bit of input from all parties involved, we are not learning to be excellent (basically the other two core values). </div>
<div><br>    Collaboration on a common goal can come about for the betterment of student education success or the betterment of a project or event within, between, or for departments ... in the long run, it's all up to us as individuals.&quot; <br> </font></div></div></div>
