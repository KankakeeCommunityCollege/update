<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass893E1747FC2B4E73BCE914699232988A">
<div>Over two days last week, nearly 700 KCC students signed a pledge to complete their degrees and certifications before leaving community college for transfer or to enter the job market.</div>
<div><br />On Oct. 25 and 26, students from several clubs and organizations positioned themselves around KCC, armed with colorful pens, large banners to sign, and information about the value of college completion. </div>
<div><br />The signing event was hosted by KCC’s Phi Theta Kappa chapter and Student Life Office. </div>
<div><br />Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society members are serving as the student arm of the Community College Completion Corps, a national education initiative to raise awareness of the importance of college completion not only for students but for colleges and the communities they serve. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Community College Completion Corps efforts have been a response to President Barack Obama’s call for community colleges to produce an additional 5 million degrees and certificates in the next 10 years, which is part of his goal to restore the United States as the world's leader in college graduates.</div>
<div><br />Pledges to complete an education will be available from KCC’s Phi Theta Kappa advisors until the end of the fall semester in December.</div>
