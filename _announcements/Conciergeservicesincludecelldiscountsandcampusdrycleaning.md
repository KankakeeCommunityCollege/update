<div><strong>Submitted by</strong> David Cagle, director of human resources</div>
<div><br>A number of services for employees through local business, called concierge services, are currently being offered.</div>
<div><br><font color="#000080"><strong>Delivery/pickup of dry cleaning<br></strong></font>One of the concierge services that KCC has had in place for a while that might not be too well known is free delivery/pick up of dry cleaning for employees through Burling Professional Cleaners. </div>
<div><br>Normal delivery/pick up is on Mondays and Wednesdays around noon on the days in which they know items are ready to be taken for cleaning. Anyone wishing to take advantage of this service can call Burling at 815-932-7811, then drop off items in the Administrative Hallway storage closet outside Room L234. New customers will have their names, contact numbers, and home billing addresses added to a database maintained by the service provider; will be given a bag with their name on it; and will be sent an invoice at the end of the month. Methods of payment available include invoicing, auto pay through credit card, or check at the time of delivery. A price sheet is posted in the Administrative Hallway storage closet. </div>
<div><br><font color="#000080"><strong>Cell phone provider discounts<br></strong></font>&quot;Can you hear me now&quot; is a question from a classic cell phone commercial. </div>
<div><br>Along those lines, anyone who can read this now, whether you are a KCC staff member or student, is entitled to a discount for cellular phone service. Just about every major cell phone provider (Cingular, Verizon, Sprint and Nextel, to name a few) offer a discount for educational institutions, even when it is an existing personal line. Take your staff/student KCC photo ID to your local provider. If you don't have an ID, visit the Learning Resource Center to get one. </div>
<div><br>You may be pleasantly surprised, like me! I am now saving 18 percent off my monthly phone bill. <br></div></div></div>
