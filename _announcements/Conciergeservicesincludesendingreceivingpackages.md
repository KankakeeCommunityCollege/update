<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass3DA77D4DD1FE41B6A573786923DE0EA6><div>Are you about to mail your Christmas cards and presents? <br></div>
<div>Need some help?<br></div>
<div>If so, please remember one of our concierge services is mailing personal outgoing shipments through the mailroom using United Parcel Service (UPS). <br></div>
<div>A tracking number is provided. The package can be shipped via UPS Ground Service, Next Day Air or Second Day Air. <br></div>
<div>UPS picks up outgoing packages around 2:30 p.m. Monday through Friday, except on some holidays. <br></div>
<div>To utilize this service, bring the package to the mailroom before 2:15 p.m. on the day it should be shipped. This allows the mailroom time for processing it. <br></div>
<div>Holidays are a very busy time for the mailroom, so keep in mind the earlier the better during those times. <br></div>
<div>Personal packages also can be received at the college. The mailroom staff will receive it and hold it for pick up. Ask the company to label the shipment with your name, as well as the college's name and address. Then, call the Physical Plant Department at 815-802-8170 or send an email to <a href="mailto:vdubie@kcc.edu">vdubie@kcc.edu</a> to communicate that a personal package will be arriving.<br></div>
<div>All personal mail (Christmas cards, standard letters etc.) must have a stamp. No personal mail can be run through the college's mail machine. If anyone is unsure of the postage, bring the envelope to the mailroom and a mailroom employee will give the needed information.<br></div>
<div>Office hours for the mailroom are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.<br></div></div></div>
