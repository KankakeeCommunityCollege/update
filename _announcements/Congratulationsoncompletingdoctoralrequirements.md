<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass66C9647FB4474CEA8589DAAFD5B87E9F">
<div><br />Congratulations to Kris Condon and Mark Lanting on completing requirements to earn doctorates.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Mark has completed an  Ed.D. from Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais. The complete degree title is doctor of education in ethical leadership. It will be conferred on May 10.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>His dissertation was &quot;Assessment of a Community College’s First Year Experience Course: Analysis of a Student Retention And Success Strategy.&quot; </div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;The research I conducted demonstrated that students passing KCC’s First Year College Experience course in the fall, 2012 semester had higher spring retention, GPAs, and pass rates than students who did not take the course,&quot; Mark said.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Kris has completed an Ed.D. from National Louis University in Chicago. The complete degree name is doctor of education in community college leadership. It will be conferred on June 21 at 2:30 p.m. (&quot;Not that I am counting,&quot; Kris joked).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Her dissertation title is &quot;The Community College as Entrepreneur:  Developing and Sustaining Effective Noncredit Workforce Training Partnerships.&quot; </div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;My study’s findings reflected that while community colleges are considered innovative, proactive, and autonomous when developing partnerships with business and industry, they are considered risk-averse and not competitively aggressive in a business sense,&quot; Kris said. &quot;The study offered a model for developing and sustaining those business and industry partnerships that better reflects business’s expectations of community colleges.&quot;</div>
