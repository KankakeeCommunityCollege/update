<div> </div>
<div>As faculty prepares material for classes and assists students with work on their assignments, copyright is an important but often overlooked consideration. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The ultimate responsibility for copyright compliance is with the faculty member. However there are resources available to assist in determining whether a specific use of material falls within Fair Use. KCC has its <a href="/FacultyStaff/copyright/Pages/default.aspx">Copyright Policy online</a>.   
<div> </div>
<div>The <a href="/FacultyStaff/copyright/Pages/educationaluse.aspx">Educational Use Guidelines</a> and <a href="/FacultyStaff/copyright/Pages/fairuse.aspx">Media/Fair Use</a> info provides additional guidelines.</div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Two questions which frequently come up are:<br /><br /><strong>Q.</strong> Why do I get copy requests returned from the Media Department?  </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>A.</strong> Requests are typically returned because there is some concern regarding copyright. Securing permission is ultimately the responsibility of the faculty member. The easiest way to notify media personnel that permission has been granted is to attach a note reading “Used with Permission” along with a citation indicating the copyright owner. More information can be found from <a href="/copyright">www.kcc.edu/copyright/.</a>  </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Q.</strong> Can I make copies of a book that is out of print for my class?   </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>A.</strong> It is important to remember that just because an item is out of print does not mean it is no longer copyright protected. In order to use the copies, the doctrine of fair use would apply. To be considered fair use, the copies must be used in a classroom setting and support learning outcomes. Consider how much of the book you need to use for your class and copy only what you need to support learning objects. What you are using can’t be in the amount that it would inhibit the copyright owner’s ability to earn a profit from their work. Finally, what type of work is it that you want to copy? Works that are more factual in nature will weigh in favor of fair use, while works of a literary nature will weigh against fair use.</div>
