<div>Three finalists in the Global Education Free Course contest  recently made presentations in an open forum to the KCC community. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The finalists and their topcs were Erik Morgan, “Child Soldiers: A Culture of Pain”; Allison Moore, “Great Days in Harlem”; and Tarah Traynor, “The North Country of New York: French and Tribal Influences.” The finalists are shown below (left to right), Moore, Morgan and Traynor. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>More than 30 audience members became judges for the event and responded in writing and with their votes.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Although the results were close, Traynor was the prize winner. She earned a free course certificate from the KCC Foundation to use toward any 3-credit hour.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The “Global Education Free Class Contest” was presented by the Cultural Diversity Committee as part of KCC's commitment to global education and as a celebration of the diversity of cultures abroad and in our own nation.</div>
