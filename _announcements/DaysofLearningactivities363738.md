<p><img alt="sbermetrics.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/sbermetrics.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />Back by popular demand, and in the spirit of spring break, spring training, and a sign of the changing of the seasons, let’s “Play Ball!.” KCC mathematics professor Mike Caparula has graciously agreed to present his educational and entertaining sabermetrics lecture “Going to WAR in baseball&quot; one more time. Learn how sabermetrics has changed “America’s pastime.”</p>
<p><strong>Denim Week<br /></strong>March 6-10<br />Wear jeans, help United Way, maybe win a big prize</p>
<p>KCC employees are invited to help <a href="https://www.myunitedway.org/">United Way of Kankakee and Iroquois Counties</a> reach its goal and continue services for those in need.</p>
<p>From March 6 to 10, employees can wear jeans every day for a $20 donation to the local United Way.</p>
<p>The $20 donation includes a 1 in 5 chance to win a “<a href="https://myunitedway.org/wheels-and-more-raffle">Wheels and More</a>” raffle ticket. Therefore, if 40 people pay $20, eight (8) $100 chance tickets will be given away.</p>
<p>Only 1,500 tickets will be sold before the drawing on March 30, so you have great odds to win a car valued up to $30,000. Additional winners will be awarded secondary prizes. Each ticket comes with a coupon book worth more than $700 in value from local restaurants and businesses.</p>
<p>To participate in Denim Week, or for more information, bring a $20 donation to David Cagle in the Human Resources Office. You can also increase your odds of winning by purchasing your own Wheels &amp; More ticket for $100. See David to purchase.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkblue">Notes:</span> The Denim Week opportunity is separate from the Friday Denim Days associated with the Employee Giving Campaign and United Way fund drive. The drawing for Wheels and More raffle prizes will be on March 30 during the United Way Annual Meeting. Winners need not be present.</p></div></div>
