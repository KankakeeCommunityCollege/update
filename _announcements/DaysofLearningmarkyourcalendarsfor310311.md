<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassD9FB7D700CF7432889E2C3A201645E7B"><p>On March 10 and 11, all supportive staff members and administrators will be strongly encouraged to attend sessions during two &quot;Days of Learning.&quot; </p>
<p>Note: faculty also are invited, but it is realized that they are on spring break that week.</p>
<p>Each day, two sessions will be offered, one from 9 a.m. - noon, and the other from 1-4 p.m. in the Iroquois Room, D152. </p>
<p>Tuesday, March 10: &quot;Unleashing Excellence to Attract and Keep Students,&quot; presented by <a href="http://unleashingexcellence.com/teri_yanovitch.html">Teri Yanovitch</a>, co-author of <em><a href="http://unleashingexcellence.com/book.html">Unleashing Excellence - the Complete Guide to Ultimate Customer Service</a></em>. She also is a former speaker and seminar leader for the Disney Institute.</p>
<p>Wednesday, March 11: “You, me, HLC &amp; KCC,” presented by members of the Higher Learning Commission Committee and Jennifer Huggins. Topics will include “The Road to Accreditation,” and “Be the Change: Become a Student Success Coach,” along with some administrative updates.</p>
<p>Since the college is not closed to the public these days, please arrange your attendance with your supervisor to stagger office coverage. Where possible, student workers and &quot;as-needed&quot; staff are suggested ways to cover work areas.</p>
<p>Please plan on participating in lunch each day from noon - 1 p.m. in the Iroquois Room.</p>
