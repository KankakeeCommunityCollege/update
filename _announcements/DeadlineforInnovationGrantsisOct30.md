<p>Innovation Grants—previously known as Awards for Excellence Mini-Grants—are a project established by the KCC Foundation to encourage the development of new ideas and/or innovations that support student success.</p>

<p>A committee of Foundation Board members and associate deans will evaluate proposals. Every effort will be made to notify award winners by the end of November.
