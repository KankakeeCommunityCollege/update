<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass3BC5F93D21EC49E9B67A159CD909020E"><div>Because it is a Friday when classes are not being held, on Aug. 3, employees will have the option to following the casual day guidelines.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Casual day guidelines are: <br /> <br />-- Participation is optional.</div>
<div> <br />-- Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public relations. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information. </div>
<div><br />-- Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded. </div>
<div><br />-- Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire. </div>
<div><br />-- All employee groups can participate. </div>
<div><br />-- Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college. <br /> <br />Questions regarding casual days should be directed to Vicki Gardner, vice president for finance and administration.</div>
