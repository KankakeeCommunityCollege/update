<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass921ED5FD376646F098082C9D3816C9F3"><p>​Because they are Fridays when classes are not being held, on Aug. 5 and Aug. 12, employees will have the option to follow the casual day guidelines.</p>
<p>As a reminder, casual day guidelines are:</p>
<ul><li>Participation is optional. </li>
<li>Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public relations. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information. </li>
<li>Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded. </li>
<li>Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire. </li>
<li>All employee groups can participate. </li>
<li>Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college. </li></ul>
<p>Questions regarding casual days should be directed to David Cagle, director of human resources.<br /></p></div></div>
