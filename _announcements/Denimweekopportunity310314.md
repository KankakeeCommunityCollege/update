<div><strong><font color="#000080">Wear jeans, help United Way, maybe win a big prize</font></strong></div>
<div><strong><font color="#000080"><br /></font></strong>KCC employees are invited to help United Way of Kankakee County reach its goal and continue services for those in need. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The week of March 10 to 14, employees can wear jeans every day for a $20 donation to United Way of Kankakee County. </div>
<div><br />The $20 donation will include a 1 in 5 chance to win a “Wheels and More” raffle ticket. Therefore, if 40 people pay $20, eight (8) $100 chance tickets will be given away.</div>
<div><br />Only 2,000 tickets will be sold before the drawing on March 27, so you have great odds to win a $30,000 car, an iPad, Cubs tickets or many other great prizes. Each ticket comes with a coupon book worth $600.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To participate in Denim Week, or for more information, bring a $20 donation to David Cagle in the Human Resources Office.</div>
<div><br />Note: The drawing for Wheels and More raffle prizes will be on March 27.  </div>
<div><br /><font color="#000080">Denim guidelines are as follows:</font><br />-- Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public relations. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information. <br />-- Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded. <br />-- Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire. <br />-- All employee groups can participate. <br />-- Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college. <br /></div>
