<p><span style="color:#760046"></span>KCC employees are invited to help United Way of Kankakee County reach its goal and continue services for those in need.</p>
<p>The week of March 9 to 13, employees can wear jeans every day for a $20 donation to United Way of Kankakee County.</p>
<p>The $20 donation will include a 1 in 5 chance to win a “Wheels and More” raffle ticket. Therefore, if 40 people pay $20, eight (8) $100 chance tickets will be given away.</p>
<p>Only 2,000 tickets will be sold before the drawing on March 26, so you have great odds to win a $30,000 car, an iPad, sports tickets or many other great prizes. Each ticket comes with a coupon book worth more than $500 in values from local restaurants and businesses.</p>
<p>To participate in Denim Week, or for more information, bring a $20 donation to David Cagle in the Human Resources Office. You can also increase your odds in winning by purchasing your own Wheels &amp; More ticket for $100. See David to purchase.</p>
<p>Note: The drawing for Wheels and More raffle prizes will be on March 26 during the United Way Annual Meeting. Winners need not be present.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkred">Denim guidelines are as follows:</span><br />-- Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and in marketing and public relations. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information. <br />-- Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded. <br />-- Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire. <br />-- All employee groups can participate. <br />-- Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college.<br /></p>
