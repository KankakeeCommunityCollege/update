<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassD3F46EF9089E4299B434020452A1D8DF"><div>Donnie Denson, head coach of the KCC Lady Cavaliers Basketball team has been named NJCAA Region 4 Coach of the Year.<br /></div>
<div>The Cavaliers finished the 2013-14 season with 28 wins and 8 losses. The team won the Region 4 Championship and represented the region at the NJCAA Division II National Tournament in Overland Park, Kan. The Cavaliers team finished the season ranked no. 10 in the nation. One player, Sarafina Handy, was named to the NJCAA All-American team.</div>
<div><br />Donnie has completed 14 seasons as the Cavaliers head coach, with an overall record of 361-107. He has led the Cavaliers to the national tournament 10 times, including two second place finishes, in 2007 and 2008.</div>
<div><br />“One thing I am sure of every year with our women’s basketball program is that no one in our region will work harder than Coach Denson,” said Ted Petersen, KCC’s athletic director. “Coach Denson is very demanding, which is required to be a great coach in competitive athletics. This approach not only prepares his players to compete in basketball, but also in life!”</div>
<div><br />Before taking over as head coach, Donnie was an assistant for KCC for three years. At KCC, Donnie also is coordinator of athletic facilities for the Athletic Department. He lives in Kankakee with his wife, Deb (also a KCC employee), and their son, David.</div>
