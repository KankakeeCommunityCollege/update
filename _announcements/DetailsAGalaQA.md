<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC3D97A9D656B493FAF34D183CAC5970C"><p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A">​<img alt="Gala fireworks" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/50thgalaheading-compressed.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />The KCC 50th anniversary Galla is coming up, and invitations have been sent.</p>
<p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A">Following are some questions people might have... Contact the KCC Foundation if you want to know about something not covered here, or for additional information. <br /> <br /><strong>When is it?</strong><br />Saturday, May 20. Cocktails are at 6 p.m. and dinner is at 7 p.m.</p>
<p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A"><strong>What’s happening that night? </strong><br />The campus will be transformed. Along with cocktails (beginning at 6 p.m.) on the North Patio, there will be music by the Dave King Quintet. During dinner, Disiree Hays, an Olivet student, will play music. Entertainment from Acting Out Theatre Company is included, too. Retired president Dr. Larry Huffman and current president, Dr. John Avendano, will deliver an excellent program. Finally, we’ll retire back to the North Patio for cocktails, more live music and fireworks!</p>
<p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A"><strong>When will invitations go out?</strong><br />Invitations were mailed on Tuesday, March 28. All KCC faculty and staff are invited.</p>
<p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A"><strong>Who will be there?</strong><br />Everyone is invited, but the event is not mandatory for faculty and staff. We are planning for more than 400 guests that evening to share remarkable moments from the past, celebrate accomplishments and envision the college's bright future.</p>
<p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A"><strong>What is the cost?</strong></p>
<p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A">Because participation is valued, tickets are reduced for faculty, staff and retirees (plus a guest). The employee/retiree cost of $75 per person covers the meal, hors d’oeuvres and drinks. Admission for community members will be $150 per person. </p>
<p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A"><strong>Why is it on our campus?</strong><br />We are having the Gala on campus because it is our home, and it’s nice to invite our alumni home again. It’s an opportunity to showcase the college, our faculty, staff and administration and--most importantly--the success of our students and alumni. </p>
<p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A"><strong>How will the space look? </strong><br />The facilities will be transformed to create elegant environments in our College Center, North Patio and Gym. This is an opportunity to share our beautiful campus with the community, and to create relationships that will benefit future students.</p>
<p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A"><strong>What should I wear?</strong><br />The event is black tie optional, which means evening attire, usually defined as suits or tuxedos for men and any length dress or formalwear for ladies.</p>
<p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A"><strong>What should I tell others about the gala?</strong></p>
<p class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A">We are proud of the quality education offered at KCC. Please extend this meaningful message to the community before, during and after the gala. Here are some highlights:</p>
<div class="ExternalClassCA2EE322541246F398F34211C6C6E64A"><ul><li>KCC is hosting the Power of Community Gala on the Riverfront Campus to highlight our beautiful campus and its amenities.</li>
<li>We chose a black tie optional event because we wanted to put our best foot forward and shine brightly.</li>
<li>The gala provides an opportunity to raise funds for scholarships and unmet needs of our students.</li>
<li>Gala locations on campus will be elegantly transformed for guests to mix, mingle and strengthen their ties to KCC.</li>
<li>50 Fabulous Alumni will be showcased. These are extraordinary men and women who have increased the value of KCC's degrees through their success.</li>
<li>All guests will be introduced to where KCC came from, what we have accomplished and goals for the future.</li></ul></div>
