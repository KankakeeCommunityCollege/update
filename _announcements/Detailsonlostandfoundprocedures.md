<div>All unattended items that are found should be turned over to the security department or brought to the first floor reception desk.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All items such as book bags, purses, cell phones, and computers are inspected for identifiers and for safety reasons. The owner is contacted if an item can be traced to a student, staff member, or visitor. If an owner is not quickly identified, the items are kept in a locked location at the reception desk.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Each year hundreds of items are turned in to the college and the majority of the items are returned or claimed within a short amount of time.” said Eric Springer, coordinator of public safety and campus operations. “Consistency in the process will ensure that anyone who has lost something can ask any college employee and be directed accordingly. The central location and standard process also helps make sure that items are returned to the proper owner as quickly as possible.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Questions regarding missing or found items can be taken to the Safety and Security Department at 815-802-8195 or 815-802-8199.</div>
