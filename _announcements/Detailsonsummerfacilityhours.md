<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassC6A1F8A921DB42299522A07371C19351>
<div>   <font size=2> Facility hours during the summer will be 6:30 a.m. - 10 p.m. Monday through Thursday. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    From May 20 to July 29 (except Friday, June 3; Friday, July 8; and Saturday, June 11), the college's main campus will be closed on Fridays and Saturdays.<br> <br>Exceptions <br>    Exceptions include Fridays, June 3 and July 8, and Saturday, June 11, 2011.</div>
<div><br>    The college will be closed Memorial Day (May 30) and open Tuesday, May 31 through Friday, June 3. It will be closed Independence Day (July 4) and open July 5 through 8. During those weeks, full-time employees will need to account for 32 work hours, four days of eight hours each, instead of 40. The other eight hours are holiday time. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>    For business reasons, a few offices located off the main campus, such as the Fitness Center at the Ice Valley Sports Arena and others, may remain open on Fridays.<br> <br>Work schedules<br>    Each full-time employee must account for 40 hours per week, with no work day longer than 10 hours. Please remember that a 30 minute break is required. The workday should begin no earlier than 6:30 a.m. Please work with your supervisor to determine which options work best for yourself and the department. </div>
<div><br>    Work options include: <br>    (1) Work Monday through Thursday, 10 hours each day <br>    (2) Work Monday through Thursday, a total of 32 to 39 hours, and account for the remaining hours to reach 40 by using vacation, comp time, and/or unpaid time off while keeping full-time benefits. <br> <br>Procedural notes<br>    - Work schedule options can be altered week to week, if needed. <br>    - Because some administrators may choose to work reduced hours at reduced pay, administrators will be required to complete individual time sheets to ensure proper payroll amounts. They are found at O:\Share\KCC\Human Resources. The file name is Administrator Time Sheet. Have them signed by your immediate supervisor, and submit them to Human Resources each pay period during the summer months. <br>    - Supportive staff employees already complete time sheets, so no change is required in their documentation. <br>    - The business of the college must be maintained. Supervisors will coordinate staff hours and need to ensure continued operations. <br>    - Supervisors may not be able to accommodate all requests for preferred work hours. <br>    - Before unpaid time off will be granted, employees must use any comp time they have available.<br>  <br> For more information, or for questions, please contact David Cagle at 815-802-8128. </div></font></div></div>
