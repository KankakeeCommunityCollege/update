<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass5B58C6DF123945B99859AB06DA8C101D"><p>Just a reminder that if you receive a call from a news reporter, or if you want to share a KCC story with the media, you should direct it to the Office of Marketing and Public Relations. </p>
<p>Marketing and Public Relations ensures that the college speaks with one voice. Having a reliable one-stop shop also fosters media confidence and builds relationships. </p>
<p>Following are a few guidelines:<br />If you receive a media inquiry, direct it to Kari Nugent or Ellen Skelly in the Office of Marketing and Public Relations.</p>
<p>It's KCC's practice to respond immediately to reporter inquiries. It’s expected that the response time is within the business day, or as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Often, news media turn to our faculty for expert opinions on trending topics. If you're speaking on KCC's behalf, answer the reporter's question honestly and as fully as possible. If you're uncertain about what to say, Kari or Ellen can help you.</p>
<p>You can reference these and other tips on our <a href="/FacultyStaff/departments/marketing/Pages/publicrelations.aspx">Public Relations </a>page. </p></div></div>
