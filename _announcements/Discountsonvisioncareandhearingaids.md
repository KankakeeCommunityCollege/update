<p>As previously communicated, a new dental program will be offered beginning in 2016.</p>
<p>Those who enroll in this voluntary dental program from the Principle Life Insurance Company are also eligible--at no extra cost--for a vision discount offered by VSP, and a hearing aid discount!  </p>
<p>These benefits will be explained at the Employee Benefits Fair, from 9 a.m. - 3 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 12 in the Iroquois and Cavalier rooms. A <a href="/FacultyStaff/departments/hr/Documents/2015%20Employee%20Benefits%20Fair%20Agenda.pdf">flier with an agenda</a> is here and on the Human Resources webpage.</p>
