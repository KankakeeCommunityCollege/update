<div>The KCC Diversity Committee has purchased a new work of art for the KCC permanent art collection.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><em>Firefly</em>, by Autumn Worth, a pastel on paper, was recently on display in the KCC student art exhibit and it was purchased at the closing reception on May 3. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;Autumn said that she feels really honored that her art was chosen and excited about having a piece of her still be here even though she won’t be here,&quot; said Nicki Depatis of Admissions and Registration, the department where Worth was a student worker. &quot;We’re all pretty proud of Autumn for being selected for this honor (and all of her hard work).&quot;<br /></div>
<div>The artwork will be framed and hung sometime this summer, said Jean Janssen, art professor.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Worth created <em>Firefly</em> as part of a KCC Figure Drawing class. She will be a 2012 KCC graduate, earning an Associate in Fine Arts Degree in Art. </div>
