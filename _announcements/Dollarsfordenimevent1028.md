<div><br />To help United Way fund 45 charitable programs in 24 member agencies and to be able to wear jeans to work that day, bring a $5 donation to Mary Posing or David Cagle.  Participants will receive a sticker to wear on Oct. 28 to show they donated to the United Way and to signify why they are wearing jeans on that day. </div>
<div><br />Last year, 40 employees participated, raising $200. This year, KCC is hoping for at least 50 participants for a minimum goal of $250. </div>
<div><br />“On behalf of the United Way of Kankakee, we can't thank you enough for all of your ongoing support,” said David. “Thanks for continuing to ‘Give a Little Bit.’&quot; </font></div>
