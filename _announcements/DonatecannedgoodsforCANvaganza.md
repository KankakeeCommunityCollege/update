<div>A friendly competition between lawyers could feed hundreds. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Kankakee-area law professionals are hosting a canned goods and non-perishable food drive from Feb. 18 to March 1, 2013. Donations are being accepted at the Kankakee County Courthouse, Kankakee Community College, and the Law Offices of Lindsay A. Parkhurst, P.C.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The initiative is part of Lawyers Feeding Illinois, a competitive food and fund-raising campaign among lawyers and legal organizations across Illinois. The competition supports the work of the eight member food banks of Feeding Illinois and is chaired by a volunteer steering committee.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“This is a competition among lawyers to take a stand against hunger to raise food and funds to support food banks serving Illinois,” said Neeley Provost Regas, attorney with Deck and Baron Law Firm in Kankakee. “Teams of lawyers across the state are competing to earn points by collecting food and funds. Donations will go to our regional food bank, so contributions directly support our local community.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The local Lawyers Feeding Illinois initiative is being coordinated by the Illinois State Bar Association program in collaboration with the Kankakee Bar Association’s Society of Women in the Law, the KCC Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program and KCC’s chapter of Lambda Epsilon Chi National Honor Society in Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies.</div>
