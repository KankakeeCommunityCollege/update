<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass7EDE91949CC045408B5FC2FF410549AE"><div><br />A group from WKCC is being formed to attend a taping of the popular NPR show <em>Wait Wait…Don’t Tell Me!</em> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The taping is Thursday, May 16 at the Chase Bank Auditorium, 10 S. Dearborn in Chicago. Doors open at 7 p.m., taping begins at 7:30 p.m. and lasts until approximately 9:30 p.m. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tickets for the May 16 taping go on sale April 5 at 10 a.m. To be part of the group, buy your ticket(s) and let Jonathan Coke, WKCC coordinator of business development, know that you are joining the group. Seating is general admission, so everyone can sit together, he said.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tickets can be purchased online. Information also is at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/wkccradio">https://www.facebook.com/wkccradio</a>, click the event button. Tickets are around $25 each, and the tapings frequently sell out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Members of the group interested in riding the Metra train to the taping are invited to contact Jonathan for more details. The theater is a 10-minute walk from Millennium Station. “It would be fun to have the group ride together and avoid the hassle of driving downtown and the cost of parking” Jonathan said. “Everyone should be home before midnight given the return train schedule. It'll be fun!”</div>
<div> </div>
