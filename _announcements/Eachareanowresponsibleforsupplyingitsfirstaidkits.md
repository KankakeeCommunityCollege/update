<p>Each area with a first aid kit is now responsible for stocking its own kit.</p>
<p>New items for the kits can be ordered from whichever vendor has the best price.<br /> <br />The change was discussed and approved by consensus at the Supportive Staff Communication Committee meeting in October. The discussion stemmed from comments that some items in first aid kits expire before they are used.<br /> <br />First aid kits are at:<br />. Technology Building -- Academic Divisions Office (Room W102) and labs<br />. First floor of L Building -- receptionist desk, Physical Plant Office, Athletics Training Room<br />. Second Floor of L Building -- Student Services Break Room and Media Department<br />. Third floor of L Building -- Academic Divisions Office (Room L355)<br />. R Building -- Room R109, Room R209, Room R309<br />. West campus -- Welding Lab (south wall) and vehicle maintenance room; and Room VA01<br />. Workforce Development Center -- Room D110<br />. Fitness Center -- Room F229<br />. Education and Employment Center -- Staff kitchen, Room 224<br />There also is a first aid kit in college vehicles.</p>
