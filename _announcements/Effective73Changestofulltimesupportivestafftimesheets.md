<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassA2707C685E37490DB93F6E7EE2184325><p>There will be a new supportive staff time sheet procedure beginning with the new fiscal year. </p>
<p>Effective July 3, all supportive staff employees will keep track of their time sheets individually. The form will reflect actual hours worked as well as any benefit time (sick, wellness, vacation, holiday, emergency closing, bereavement, comp time) taken.      </p>
<p>Another change to the form is that supportive staff will sign in and out for lunch breaks, and time worked will be automatically calculated.</p>
<p>In alignment with payroll periods, the new timesheets will be turned in every other week, instead of weekly.</p>
<p>As in the past, the employee's signature indicates agreement that the total hours are correct, and the supervisor's signature authorizes payment for the hours as recorded on the time sheet.    </p>
<p>Another timesheet procedure which has not changed is that supervisors must review, sign and forward timesheets to the Payroll Office no later than noon on the Wednesday following the end of the scheduled pay period.    </p>
<p>The timesheet procedures described above only affect full time supportive staff. Administrators should continue using the administrator time sheets for the remainder of the summer. </p>
<p>Anyone with questions is invited to contact Jane Clark at 815-802-8146.  <br>    The forms and appropriate information: <br>    Timesheet: O:\Share\KCC\Human Resources\HR FORMS\SS TIMESHEET INFORMATION\TIMESHEET.xls<br>    Instructions: O:\Share\KCC\Human Resources\HR FORMS\SS TIMESHEET INFORMATION\FY12 TIME SHEET <br>INSTRUCTIONS.docx<br>    Check dates for 2011-12: O:\Share\KCC\Human Resources\HR FORMS\SS TIMESHEET INFORMATION\FY12 PAYROLL <br>CHECK DATES.xls<br></p></div></div>
