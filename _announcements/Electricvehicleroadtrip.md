<div><font size="2">A relay of electric vehicles will cross more than 450 miles of Illinois, stopping in Bradley at 8 a.m. Wednesday, June 25.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The “EV Road Trip” will begin in Carterville June 23 and will make 12 promotional stops along its way to Grayslake on June 25. The Bradley stop will be at the Kankakee Community College North Extension Center, 450 N. Kinzie Ave. Refreshments will be served from 8-8:45 a.m.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Eleven community colleges, plus the Governor’s Mansion in Springfield, are on the route.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“It’s nice to be part of a statewide demonstration that electric vehicles are here to stay and that it’s possible to drive all around the state,” said Bert Jacobsen, KCC dean of environmental and institutional sustainability.  “There are enough charging stations along the route from south to north Illinois that you could get partial charges all the way from one end of the state to the other.”</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The trip begins at John A. Logan College, the southernmost “charged” community college in Illinois. From there, electric cars will go from college to college, with a new driver and car taking over at many of the colleges along the way. Eight electric cars will be used. The stops, in order, are John A. Logan College, Carterville; Kaskaskia College, Centralia; Southwestern Illinois College, Belleville; Lewis &amp; Clark  Community College, Godfrey; Governor’s Mansion, Springfield; Heartland Community College, Normal; KCC, Bradley; Prairie State College, Chicago Heights; Moraine Valley Community College, Palos Hills; Triton College, River Grove; and Wilbur Wright College of Chicago. The relay includes some short drives to visit charging stations in Centralia, Lincoln and Pontiac.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The longest leg will be 93 miles from Lewis and Clark Community College to the Governor’s Mansion. The shortest segment between colleges is 5.4 miles from Triton College to Wilbur Wright College.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Hove Nissan of Bradley is loaning KCC a Nissan Leaf to use for the local leg of the journey. The Leaf will depart from the electric car power station in the parking lot at the KCC North Extension Center before setting off for Prairie State College.</font></div>

<p><font size="2">“Our charging station is a Chargepoint® 240 volt level 2 charging station,” Jacobson said. “Which is not the highest level so it would take about four hours for a full charge. But we’re excited about this relay because first of all it’s going to be fun. It gives us an opportunity among our colleagues from across the state to do something together. It also gives us an opportunity to highlight our new North Extension Center that’s a LEED gold building with an EV charging station.”</font></p>
