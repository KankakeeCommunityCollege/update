<div><br />The 2013 Employee Giving Campaign is off to a great start thanks to the generosity of faculty and staff! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In its first few days, the campaign has already exceeded last year’s participation totals and is quickly catching up to last year’s financial totals.<br /></div>
<div><strong>Campaign</strong> …..<strong>Participation</strong> …….<strong>Funds raised<br /></strong>2012 ………….....33% total …….…. $18,239 for the entire campaign<br />2013 ………....… 39% total ……….. $15,011 as of Sept. 13</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Open enrollment for the campaign will continue through Oct. 13, 2013, and employees can contribute at any time during the fiscal year. In addition, some friendly rivalry between departments led to the creation of a special raffle: All departments who achieve 100% participation before Oct. 13 will be entered into a raffle for a special gift basket donated by Jane Clark and the KCC Foundation. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The basket will include Tootsie Pops, Junior Mints, Sugar Babies, Charleston Chews, Junior Caramels, Cookies, Carmel Apple Suckers, and other fun treats.<br /></div>
<div>Again this year, the campaign goal is 100% participation. Your support sends an important message to the community and prospective donors: No one knows KCC better than we do, and we care enough to give back. If you haven’t signed up for employee giving yet, please contact the KCC Foundation or visit the employee giving web page.<br /></div>
<div>Thank you to everyone who has supported the campaign! Watch for regular announcements as the campaign progresses.<br /></div>
