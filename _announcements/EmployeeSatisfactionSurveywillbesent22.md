<p><a href="mailto:dcagle.kcc.edu"><img alt="Candid-comments-icon.png" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Candid-comments-icon.png" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" /></a>After taking one year off, KCC is once again encouraging all full-time employees, current adjunct instructors, and part-time employees averaging 16 hours or more of work per week to complete an employee satisfaction survey. </p>
<p>In 2013, we had 191 responses. This year, our goal is for at least 210 employees to complete the survey.</p>
<p>The survey link will be emailed on Feb. 2. It should take about 20 minutes to complete. Noel Levitz is administering the survey and--as a third-party--helps assure that answers will be confidential. Information pertaining to individual identities will not be shared.</p>
<p>The survey will be available until 11:59 p.m. Saturday, Feb. 28.</p>
<p>This will be the sixth year we have used Noel Levitz to administer the survey. It allows for comparison between years to see how we are doing, as well as a comparison to approximately 30 other community colleges across the nation. </p>
<p>We hope to have the survey results compiled and distributed sometime in April.</p>
<p>Here are previous questions and answers related to the survey:<br /><strong>Q: </strong>Can the survey be saved and restarted if I am interrupted? <br /><strong>A:</strong> Yes, as long as you use the same computer when returning to the survey.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can we offer incentives to employees for completing the survey to increase participation? <br /><strong>A:</strong> Though there are too many surveys to always give an incentive, KCC is offering an incentive for this one. Upon completion of the survey, you can print a coupon for a medium coffee or 20-ounce soft drink ($1.59 value) redeemable at the Hammes Café. Additionally, if you put your name on the back of the coupon, you will be entered for another reward: four names will be drawn, and each person will recieve a $25 Walmart gift certificate. </p>
<p>As always, thank you in advance for your cooperation and honest/constructive feedback.<br /><br />***</p>
