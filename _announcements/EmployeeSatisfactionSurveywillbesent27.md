<div><font size=2><strong>From: </strong>David Cagle, director of human resources<br> <br>By the end of the day, Monday, Feb. 7, we will ask all full-time employees, current adjunct instructors, and part-time employees averaging 16 hours or more of work per week to complete an employee satisfaction survey. <br> </font></div>
<div><font size=2>The link to the survey will be e-mailed to all those listed above by the end of the day Feb. 7.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>The survey should take about 20 minutes to complete.<br></font></div>
<div><font size=2>To give employees adequate time to complete it, the survey will be available for approximately three weeks, with a cut off time of 5 p.m. on Friday, Feb 25. <br></font></div>
<div><font size=2> This will be the third year we have used Noel Levitz to administer the survey. It allows for comparison between years, as well as comparison to approximately 20 other community colleges. We hope to have the survey results compiled and distributed in early March. Thank you in advance for your cooperation and honest/constructive feedback.</font></div></div></div>
