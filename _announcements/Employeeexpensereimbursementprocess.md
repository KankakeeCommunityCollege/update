<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass9E0C52444BAC4EFCA8B6A563F08A676C><div><font size=2>From Mary Martin, director of financial affairs<br> <br>    Typically, most employees submit expense reimbursements within a 30 (thirty) day timeframe. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    There is good reason to continue this practice, and for those few employees who have not gotten into the habit of submitting expense reimbursements on a monthly basis, there is a need to begin doing so.</div>
<div><br>    The Internal Revenue Service has specific rules regarding employee expense reimbursements, especially in terms of timing, to avoid taxation. To ensure KCC is in compliance with IRS rules, a new requirement will be in place. </div>
<div><br>    While the 30 (thirty) day window for any expense submissions is preferred, reimbursement must be adequately accounted for no later than 60 days after the date of occurrence. Failure to comply within the established timeframe results in the reimbursement being taxed as wages, per the IRS. </div>
<div><br>    This requires that requests for reimbursement, with all the necessary forms and appropriate approval signatures must be submitted to the Business Office on or before the 60th day after the expense was incurred or paid. </div>
<div><br>    Supervisors may require earlier submission to allow adequate time for review. Those complying with the required timeline will continue to receive reimbursement by accounts payable check, as in the past.</div>
<div><br>    However, going forward, any taxable reimbursements (those which do not reach the Business Office with proper documentation within 60 days of occurrence) will be made on paychecks under a separate type code.</div>
<div><br>    In the event that your expensed reimbursement is taxed as wages on your W-2, you have the option of offsetting the taxable reimbursement on your federal tax return subject to all applicable IRS regulations; please see your tax advisor for additional assistance.</div>
<div><br>    Please realize that this policy is driven by IRS requirements, and KCC is taking action to ensure compliance and to help employees avoid taxation on expense reimbursements.</div>
<div><br>    Questions should be directed to Mary Martin</font> at 815-802-8142. <br> </div></div></div>
