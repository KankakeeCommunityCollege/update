<div><font size=2>On Feb. 7, full-time employees, current adjunct instructors, and part-time employees averaging 16 hours or more of work per week received an e-mail including a link to complete an employee satisfaction survey.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>The survey will be available until 5 p.m. Friday, Feb. 25. The survey should take about 20 minutes to complete. This is the third year KCC has used Noel Levitz to administer the survey. It allows for comparison between years, as well as comparison to approximately 20 other community colleges. </font></div>
