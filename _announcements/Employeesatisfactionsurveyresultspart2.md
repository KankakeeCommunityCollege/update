<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassD430B78359844D35854A56638FF21FFC"><p>​This is the second in a series sharing results of the employee satisfaction survey given in February.</p>
<p>Following is a summary of results and analysis from Purva DeVol, Ph.D., director of institutional research.</p>
<p style="color:darkred">General</p>
<ul><li>173 employees completed the survey (9% fewer than the 190 in 2013)</li>
<li>Results analyzed and compared to national peer group of 44 two-year colleges in 23 states (three in Illinois, including KCC), one in Canada</li>
<li>Satisfaction means exceeded 3.0 for all items, significantly higher than peer group. </li></ul>
<p><span style="color:darkred">Top 3 strengths</span></p>
<p>Items ranked highest in importance and satisfaction are KCC’s strengths:<br />1. This institution is well-respected in the community.<br />2. The leadership of this institution has a clear sense of purpose. <br />3. This institution treats students as its top priority. (Same ranking in 2013.)<br /><br /><span style="color:darkred">Increased satisfaction</span></p>
<p>Comparison of 2013 and 2015 results revealed three additional statements of increased satisfaction.<br />1. The institution does a good job meeting the needs of its faculty.<br />2. The institution consistently follows clear processes for orienting and training new employees. (Likely correlated with New Employee Orientation.)<br />3. The institution consistently follows clear processes for recognizing employee achievements.</p>
<p style="color:darkred">Top 3 opportunities</p>
<p>Items with highest importance but lowest satisfaction are opportunities for KCC. The top 3 opportunities (two are tied) were also among the top in 2013:<br />1. There are effective lines of communication between departments.<br />2. There is a spirt of teamwork and cooperation at this institution.<br />3. There is good communication between the faculty and the administration at this institution.<br />3. There is good communication between staff and the administration at this institution.<br /><br /><span style="color:darkred">Notable differences compared to peer group</span><br />1. Priority goal ranked higher at KCC: “Improve the appearance of campus building and grounds.” This is strengthened by open-ended comments stating desires to have an institutional goal on campus-wide facility improvement more than any topic.<br />2. Senior administrators perceived as having a lower involvement in planning and decision making.<br />3. Overall satisfaction with employment at 4.16, compared to 3.90 for peer group.<br /><br /><span style="color:darkred">Top 2 statements to watch </span><br />1. “There are effective lines of communication between departments.” This statement received the lowest satisfaction ratings in both 2013 (3.01) and 2015 (3.18), compared to significantly lower peer group mean of 2.86. An item correlation showed KCC employees desire more than dissemination of information.</p>
<p>2. “I have adequate opportunities for advancement.” The second lowest perceived satisfaction was with this statement. It is bolstered by open-ended comments that relate to KCC’s core values of excellence and learning, including asking for succession planning, promoting “from within,” and training.</p>
<p>In future <em>Updates</em>, more information will be shared including a comparison of 2015 results with 43 other two year schools across the nation, and a summary of responses to the open ended questions. </p>
