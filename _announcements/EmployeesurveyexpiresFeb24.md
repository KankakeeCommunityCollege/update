<div><br>Greetings everyone! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As you all may know, the college, through the great work of the Employee Morale Committee, has been focused on measuring and impacting the culture of our institution for the better. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Over the past few years KCC has used an instrument from a national company, Noel Levitz. This instrument has been administered the past three times for measuring where the college excels and where we can improve. The Noel Levitz Employee Satisfaction Survey was distributed approximately a week and a half ago. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Wednesday, Feb. 15 at noon marked the half-way point for the window of opportunity to complete and submit your feedback. So far, 142 have responded out of our goal of 250 (57%). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would encourage everyone eligible to complete the survey and help us continue to improve the overall culture of KCC. (The link was sent by email from David Cagle both on Feb. 6 and Feb. 15).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As always, thank you all for your dedication and commitment to KCC, our students, and our community.<br></div></div></div>
