<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass697B967C70BE48CD843B8B44260C30DF><div><font size=2>From:Â Rich Soderquist, director of facilities and campus safety </font></div>
<div><font size=2><br>As everyone is aware by now, the college needs to save financial resources wherever it can. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>One very simple way to help do this is by conserving electric energy. The biggest contributor to electric use is lighting. Generally, lighting contributes between 60 percent and 65 percent of an electric bill. The electric bill at KCC is about 66 percent of our utility costs each year. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>Here are ways we all can help: <br>-- Whenever we leave our work space empty, even for a short time, turn off the lights. It will not hurt the bulbs or light fixtures. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>-- Whenever we notice lights on in areas that are not being used, ask the right person if the lights can be turned off. </div>
<div><br>-- Whenever possible, we should use natural daylight instead of electric lighting. </div>
<div><br>-- It may be possible in some areas to disconnect some fixtures and leave others active and still retain good quality productive lighting. Contact Physical Plant at 815-802-8170. </div>
<div><br>-- When we leave a general staff area (non-public or student area) such as a bathroom, break room storage area or general work area, turn the lights off. </div>
<div><br>-- When anyone sees exterior lighting on during daylight hours notify Physical Plant Department at 815-802-8170 so that timers or sensors can be adjusted. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>Other ways to save the cost of electricity:<br>-- Turn computers off when not in use for extended periods. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>-- Turn off any other electronic devices when not in use. </div>
<div><br>-- Turn off power strips when not in use. Some electronic devices use up to three quarters of full power on internal components when not turned on. <br></div></font></div></div>
