<div>On April 26, KCC will host an event for prospective students to take the express route to enrollment.</div>
<div><br />The “Enrollment Express” event will be Saturday, April 26 from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. The college will have information about programs as well as the opportunity to take admissions tests, meet advisors, register and apply for financial aid. Admissions testing will be open from 9 a.m. - 1 p.m.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“The event is organized so that students can accomplish a variety of goals,” said Denise Burklow, coordinator of recruitment services at KCC. “For those who want to leisurely explore what KCC offers, several program coordinators and advisers will be on hand to provide information. But, for busy people who want to tackle all the enrollment pieces in one day, we’re offering computerized testing and registration.”</div>
