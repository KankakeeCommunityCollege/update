<div>On Thursday, Sept. 12, Kevin Spalek, a 21 year old student-entrepreneur from Stuhr, a suburb near to Bremen, Germany, was a guest speaker of the Introduction to Entrepreneurship class, taught by Walt Shipman.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Spalek spoke for 30 minutes on his experience as an entrepreneur, entrepreneurship in general, and the free enterprise system. Spalek said that at a young age he saw the advantages of utilizing the Internet as a means of marketing. Being interested in videography, <a href="http://www.vimeo.com/kevlifa">Spalek made videos</a> of cities such as Sydney, Australia; Chicago; and New York under his screen name “Kevlifa.”</div>
<div><br />His videos on YouTube lead to bookings for videos of dance/night clubs, clothing lines and American rap stars. He then had the opportunity to develop a line of clothing with friends, named “<a href="http://www.graceworld-clothing.com/">Grace World Clothing</a>.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Grace World Clothing was been worn by the American rapper Red Café at a party hosted by Sean Combs in Las Vegas. Also, first league soccer players such as Eljero Elia and Loris Karius as well as German TV reality-show stars have shown their support for the movement over the Internet.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Spalek also told the class of seeing an opportunity and pursuing it despite opposition from friends and family. He emphasized “if you see an opportunity and you have that drive to succeed,” being persistent will reward you. He offered that two of his former video buyers also now work with him as partners; one as lead designer and the other is the clothing line founder. Spalek heads up marketing and technology.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Currently, Spalek is pursuing a bachelor's degree in communications in Germany and will attend the European Media and Business Academy (EMBA) in Berlin, Germany this October to study communication management.</div>
