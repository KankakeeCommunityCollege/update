<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassFA96690213C542CC8E1C8C5DEB2CA26C">
<div><font size="2">From: Beth Nunley, director of financial affairs<br /> <br />Typically, most employees submit expense reimbursements within a 30-day timeframe.  <br /> <br />There is good reason to continue this practice, and for those few employees who have not been submitting expense reimbursements on a monthly basis, there is a need to begin doing so.<br /> <br />The Internal Revenue Service has specific rules regarding employee expense reimbursements, especially in terms of timing, to avoid taxation. <br /> <br />To ensure KCC is in compliance with the IRS rules, a new requirement is now in place: All requests for reimbursement, including the necessary forms and appropriate approval signatures, be submitted to the Business Office on or before the 60th day after the expense was incurred or paid.  <br /> <br />Supervisors may require earlier submission to allow adequate time for review. <br /> <br />Requests for reimbursement not received in the Business Office on or before the 60th day will be added to your paycheck and taxed as wages.<br /> <br />Again, this policy is driven by IRS requirements, and through it, KCC is ensuring compliance. It also will help employees avoid taxation on expense reimbursements.<br /> <br />Questions should be directed to Beth Nunley at </font><span style="white-space:nowrap" class="baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1"><font size="2">815-802-8142</font></span><font size="2">.</font></div>
