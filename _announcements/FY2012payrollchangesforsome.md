<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassDE0D0CA022DA4CC69FC1F612CC0A3EC3><div><br><font color="#000080"><strong>Info sessions May 10, 11, 12 will offer full details</strong></font></div><font color="#000080">
<div><br></font>Excellence is a core value to which we all strive to achieve.</div>
<div><br>The Human Resources Office, and specifically the payroll department, is making some changes that will streamline their processing and afford more time to provide excellent service to employees. Most staff are probably not aware, but the payroll department has been running two pay cycles, one that pays employees “To Date,” and one that pays employees “Two Weeks in Arrears.”</div>
<div><br>Effective July 2011, they will begin the process of moving all employees to the “arrears” method, which will eliminate many manual adjustments they currently make, streamlining the processing. </div>
<div><br>It is <strong>important to note </strong>that the change will <strong>not affect </strong>everyone.</div>
<div><br>It also is <strong>very important </strong>to note that <strong>everyone who will be affected</strong> will still <strong>continue to receive a check</strong> every two weeks. </div>
<div><br><font size=2><strong>Who is affected:</strong> </font>Administrators and other full-time supportive staff. It is <strong>critically important </strong>that everyone in those categories <strong>attend a session to learn the details </strong>of the new plan. <br><strong><font size=2>Who is not affected: </font></strong>Faculty, hourly Physical Plant employees and part-time employees need not be concerned, as they are not affected.<br></div>
<div><font color="#000080"><strong>Information sessions<br></strong></font>Sessions are scheduled for the following dates and times in Room D140, the Workforce Development Center Conference Hall:</div>
<div><br>Tuesday, May 10, 3:30-4 p.m.<br>Wednesday, May 11, 10-10:30 a.m.<br>Thursday, May 12, 2-2:30 p.m.</div>
<div><br>Following the presentations at the sessions, there will be plenty time for questions. It is the goal that all questions will be answered in the sessions, and that everyone leaves with a clear understanding of the changes.<br></div></div></div>
