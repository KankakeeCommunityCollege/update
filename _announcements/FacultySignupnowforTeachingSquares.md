<p>This voluntary program attempts to improve teaching and build community through a structured, non-evaluative process of classroom observation and shared reflection. The Teaching Squares program requires about one hour per week for seven weeks, and is an excellent activity to list on Professional Development Plans. </p>
<p>The kickoff meeting will be Thursday, Feb. 9 at 4:30 p.m. in Room L344.</p>
<p>Teaching Squares is presented by the Faculty Growth Committee and Teaching and Learning Center.</p>
