<div><em>Update</em>, the staff newsletter, is delivered in several ways so employees can choose how they receive college information.</div>
<div><br /><strong>RSS feeds </strong>are delivered to your Outlook mailbox. RSS – Really Simple Syndication – sends you a notification whenever an item is added to <em>Daily Update </em>online. You can open it like an email and see the content of the article or event. You must subscribe to RSS feeds to get them. You have to set up your Outlook mailbox so you can see when a new RSS item arrives. Complete information on how to sign up is on the <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Pages/updateRSS.aspx">&quot;Receive Update via RSS Feed&quot; page</a>. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you sign up and don’t get notifications, email <a href="mailto:update@kcc.edu">update@kcc.edu</a> and someone will assist you personally. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Note: <em>Update</em> events and <em>Update</em> announcements are separate RSS feeds, and you must subscribe to both separately.</div>
<div><br /><strong><em>Online Update</em></strong> has all “current” <em>Update</em> announcements and events in one place. Announcements are shown with the most recent posts on top. Events appear in date order. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Announcements are visible until they expire – usually two weeks. Events are visible until the event ends. For both announcements and events, the first few lines of text are shown – unformatted – in the main window. Click on the title. to see the full artcle. The side navigation has options including <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Pages/recent.aspx">Recent Updates</a> -- announcements posted within the past seven days and events scheduled for the next seven days. The side navigation also has links to the evening administrator and R25 campus calendar.</div>
<div><br />The <strong>weekly <em>Update</em> email </strong>is sent on Monday mornings. For the most part, it is a snapshot of the <em>Online Update</em>. Most of the content is the full text of announcements posted in the last seven days and of events which will occur during the coming week. It also includes links to announcements which have been online for more than a week, and links to events which are more than a week away. When a new video is posted to KCC’s You Tube channel, the weekly email includes a link. The email also has links to other helpful sites for employees: events, jobs, evening administrator/advisor, food service menu, candid comments, KCC on Facebook, and KCC on Twitter. There’s also a link to send an email to <a href="mailto:update@kcc.edu">update@kcc.edu</a> to share comments and questions about the newsletter.</div>
<div><br />A reminder about <em>Update</em> also is sent by email each week, usually on Wednesday. <br /></div>
<div>Among all of these options, we hope everyone is able to stay informed. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you have any questions or comments about how Update is delivered, please share them either directly at <a href="mailto:eskelly@kcc.edu">eskelly@kcc.edu</a>, 815-802-8279 or email <a href="mailto:update@kcc.edu">update@kcc.edu</a>. <br /></div>
