<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass3C97481EB8CC4BAA81B5F0AD26FE0761"><p>​The Teaching and Learning Center cordially invites all faculty to participate in the Fall Canvas Challenge course starting the first week of September. </p>
<p>We learn best by doing, and that’s the idea behind this course in which participants complete a series of authentic core Canvas tasks in their own practice sandbox.</p>
<p>When done, you’ll earn the Canvas Challenge completion badge. Each week, a cohort of participants will be asked to complete one challenge and associated activities. All activities can be completed online at your convenience during the week.</p>
<p>More than 40 KCC faculty and staff who have already taken on the Canvas Challenge - it is time for more to join their ranks. Here are quotes from past participants:</p>
<ul><li>“I learned something that could be used to improve my own course almost every week.”</li>
<li>“Taking this course has helped me so much this year! It has made me realize what students are experiencing working in Canvas.”</li>
<li>“I also appreciated seeing so many examples from live courses. It has helped me to rethink some of my own presentation.”<br /> </li></ul>
