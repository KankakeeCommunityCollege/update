<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassEA70F74AFB1E4704B0D298319C1E2868"><p>​Cari Stevenson, assistant professor in the Humanities and Social Sciences Division, received the first place Teaching Resources Award from the APA Psychology Teachers at Community Colleges for “What if Freud Had Facebook?”</p>
<p>The award encourages community college faculty to share instructional techniques. Cari’s lesson teaches students about theories of development. For the lesson, students were divided into groups and assigned one of 10 human development theorists. Freud’s Facebook page was provided as a sample and posted on the Canvas, the learning management system. Students used it as a template to create their own Facebook pages for their assigned theorist. </p>
<p>Cari will receive the award at the American Psychological Association Convention in Toronto next month. She also will give a presentation about student services for military veterans.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Cari!<br /></p>
