<div> </div>
<div>Please join the Faculty Growth and Development Committee in congratulating two of our faculty in their nominations for the 2012 Illinois Community College Trustees Association Outstanding Faculty Awards.<br /></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our full time faculty representative is <strong>Jessica Fehland</strong>.  Jessica’s contributions to the college are truly impressive. <img alt="Jessica Fehland" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/JessicaFehland.jpg" width="209" height="131" /><a href="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/JessicaFehland.jpg"></a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the classroom she has built a rapport with students by providing a variety of creative learning opportunities. She values student feedback and works to continually improve her course materials and delivery methods. Jessica serves on multiple committees both on and off campus. She’s been an Academic Quality Improvement Program liaison, a representative on the Illinois Associate of Arts in Teaching committee, and a lead promoter of sustainability issues.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We’re lucky to have Jessica’s considerable talents at KCC, and proud to support her candidacy for this award.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The part time faculty representative selected is <strong>Jennifer Huggins</strong>. Jennifer has taught in multiple divisions at KCC and is noted for her ethic and passion. <img style="width:222px;height:129px" alt="Jennifer Huggins" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/JHuggins.jpg" width="238" height="141" /></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Students rave about her instructional activities that are designed for practical application in real world scenarios. They express appreciation for her overall commitment to their success. Jennifer’s a true role model for students and colleagues alike through active volunteerism.  She works with the colleges’ ALIVE Adult Literacy Program, and helped implement a women’s book club at Jerome Combs Detention Center near our campus. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>According to the program supervisor, “She is instilling a passion for the written word and giving them a confidence boost that they have never had.” It is a great pleasure to have Jennifer considered for this award on behalf of KCC.<br /></div>

 the skills learned in speech will be used in other courses, other colleges and their future careers. </p>
<p>“Communication is the key which opens doors for a student's future,&quot; Tinker said. &quot;Encouraging students to realize the parallels between classroom skills and those needed for future productivity is essential. Often students come to speech class with high-anxiety levels and self-doubt. Most of those find success in my class coupled with earning self-confidence and pride. Educating students is a privilege which I take very seriously. If the day arrives when I look at education as a job, I will walk away. It takes energy, passion, strength and enthusiasm to teach.”</p>
<p>In addition, Tinker is widely respected as a voice on the adjunct faculty union, and she serves on numerous committees, and has been a mentor to new adjunct faculty. </p>
<p>Tinker also has received many accolades for her role in the community.</p>
<p>We are proud to have both Kari and Tinker represent us for the annual award. Others who were nominated by students and colleagues for their excellence in teaching were JuTun Andrews-King, Diane Berger, Kris Condon, Steve DePasquale, Kim DeYoung, Diane Goldenstein, Ed Gilbert, Nick Grad, Jessica Greminger, Jennifer Huggins, James Kinzer, Scott Kistler, Cory Lewis, Amy Porter, Chelise Slowik, Cari Stevenson and Helen Streicher.</p>
