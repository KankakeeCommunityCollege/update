<div>The community is invited to join two KCC professors in reading and discussing <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> by economist Thomas Piketty.</div>
<div><br />“Because of the ongoing discussion of economic inequality on the national media and political scene, Piketty’s explanation of economic inequality and a solution for it has stirred a lot of discussion,” said Scott Kistler, one of the discussion leaders. “We thought that we could have some of that discussion here at KCC.”</div>
<div><br />The discussions will be from 1-2 p.m. Wednesdays, Sept. 10 to Nov. 19, and Dec. 3 in KCC Room L315. The first session will be on the introduction. After that, there will be one chapter per week until Nov. 19. Chapters 11 and 12 will be discussed on Dec. 3. <br />The KCC professors leading the discussions are Steve DePasquale and Kistler.</div>
<div><br />“These sessions will be devoted to a serious discussion of the ideas in these books. Students and the community are welcome to attend and ask questions,” Kistler said. “Those who wish to contribute to the discussion are asked to read the material ahead of time.”</div>
<div><br />The book (ISBN: 9780521367011) is available in the KCC Hammes Bookstore. </div>
<div><br />The discussion of <em>Capital in the Twenty-First Century</em> will conclude in the spring semester with the final four chapters. </div>
<div><br />Kistler also shared that Piketty's book has “been embraced by commentators on the more liberal and progressive end of our political spectrum. We will be looking next semester at a book that won the praises of more conservative commentators for its cultural commentary: Charles Murray's <em>Coming Apart</em>.”</div>
<div><br />For more information, contact Kistler at 815-802-8706, or email <a href="mailto:skistler@kcc.edu">skistler@kcc.edu</a>.<br /></div>
