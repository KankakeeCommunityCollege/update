<p>Congratulations to the KCC community!</p>
<p>KCC conducted the required fall semester evacuation drills on Sept. 13. During the afternoon drillx our evacuation time of 2 minutes 40 seconds was the quickest ever -- beating the old record by 8 seconds. </p>
<p>The morning drill was slightly slower at 3 minutes 20 seconds. The difference was largely due to staff, students and visitors who were reluctant to evacuate. An additional 25 seconds was added to the time while campus police and public safety staff encouraged full participation. Without that delay, the college would have evacuated the full campus in 2 minutes 55 seconds. </p>
<p>Twenty-five seconds can make the difference between life and death in a true evacuation, whether it be due to fire, earthquake, bombing, or other hazardous situation. </p>
<p style="color:blue">Volunteer to be a floor monitor</p>
<p>in the interest of public safety, and working through the Campus Safety Committee, we are reviving the emergency floor monitor program. Volunteers are being accepted to assist in emergency situations. For more information about becoming a floor monitor, please contact Eric Springer at 815-802- 8195. </p>
<p>As we continue to drill and improve our emergency response capability, please remember how important it is that our campus remain prepared for any event, and that preparation is best achieved through practice. Thank you for your continued cooperation and support. And again, Congratulations! <br /></p></div></div>
