<div>Federal financial aid is still available for KCC students, especially the unemployed.</div>
<div><br>To apply for federal financial aid, students must complete a FAFSA. Applications are available at <a href="http://www.fafsa.gov/">www.fafsa.gov</a>. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Students are encouraged to apply regardless of their income levels,” said Julia Waskosky, dean of student development. “Many of our students face economic challenges. They may have lost their jobs, or are juggling their job and class commitments. Many of them also are caring for children and aging parents. Despite the challenges, they make education a priority because they know it’s the path to greater prosperity, especially in these tough economic times.”</div>
