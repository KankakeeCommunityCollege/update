<div><font color="#0000ff" size="2">Submitted by David Cagle, director of human resources, Employee Morale Committee co-chair</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />One of the three current AQIP Action Projects is assessing the effectiveness of the personnel evaluation forms that were revised last year. </div>
<div><br />The Employee Morale Committee has taken the leadership on this endeavor and is now seeking your formal feedback. </div>
<div><br />Accomplishments/improvements thus far as a result of informal feedback: <br /></div>
<div>• Aligning our core values to each evaluation form (faculty, supervisory &amp; non-supervisory staff).<br />• Designing the forms to be more visually appealing, easier to read, clearly separating each section.<br />• Adding a “Comments” field under each performance factor for both the employee and the supervisor to complete.<br />• Including spell check in the fill-in areas.<br />• Tidying up the Goals/Objectives and Professional Growth &amp; Development sections to make it easier to complete</div>
<div></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">In an effort to continue our quality improvement efforts, we want to know what else needs to be done. On Monday, Jan. 9, all employees will receive an email from me with one or more evaluation forms to review. The form(s) you receive should be the one(s) which most closely impact you.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />Please email me suggestions for further improvement by 5 p.m. on Friday, Jan. 20. It is our intent to incorporate feedback into the forms when we start using them within the next few months.  <br /><a href="mailto:dcagle@kcc.edu"><img alt="feedback icon" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/feedback1.gif" /></a></div>
<div>Thank you in advance for your cooperation and input.</div>
