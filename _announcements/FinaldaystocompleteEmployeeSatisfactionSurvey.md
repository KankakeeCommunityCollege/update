<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass3D5530D1EBDC4F70A482B76EF66E63CE><div><font size=2>On Feb. 7, full-time employees, current adjunct instructors, and part-time employees averaging 16 hours or more of work per week received an e-mail including a link to complete an employee satisfaction survey.<br></font></div>
<div><font size=2>The survey will be available until 5 p.m. Friday, Feb. 25. The survey should take about 20 minutes to complete. This is the third year KCC has used Noel Levitz to administer the survey. It allows for comparison between years, as well as comparison to approximately 20 other community colleges. <br></font></div>
<div><font size=2>&quot;To date, (Feb. 21), over 100 employees have responded,&quot; said David Cagle, director of human resources. “Hopefully, we will have a great response THIS WEEK to garner more employee feedback.  If you haven’t yet completed the survey, please do so before Friday.  We hope to have the survey results compiled and distributed in March. Thank you in advance for your cooperation and honest feedback.&quot; <br></font></div>
<div><font size=2>Anyone with questions while taking the survey is invited to contact David at 815-802-8128. <br></font></div></div></div>
