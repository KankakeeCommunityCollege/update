<div> </div>
<div>The deadline to enter the 2013 United Way Wheels &amp; More vehicle raffle is quickly approaching.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As of April 18, only 400 tickets have been sold so far. That means everyone who has a ticket has a great chance at winning any vehicle valued up to $30,000 from one of five participating dealerships!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tickets are $100 each, and must be purchased by Thursday, April 25. The drawing will be at the United Way Annual Dinner on Thursday, April 25, 2013.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each ticket includes more than $850 in free food and services from local restaurants and businesses. There also are secondary prizes like Chicago Cubs and White Sox tickets, an iPad and free golf at several local courses.</div>
<div><br />Most importantly, the funds raised go to support vital programs at 25 local United Way agencies.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You can purchase tickets from me or by going on the <a href="http://myunitedway.org/Wheels_and_More_Raffle.php">United Way of Kankakee County website</a> to purchase them securely. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you in advance for your continued support.</div>
