<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassFE048B266B024F20BBB238A45DAE0C32"><p>​A free college financial aid and scholarships session will be held at the Kankakee Community College Miner South Extension Center Tuesday, Feb. 3 from 6-7:30 p.m. <br /><br />The event is for all students and parents preparing to apply for college financial aid and scholarships, not just those planning to attend KCC. The Miner South Extension Center is at 1488 E. Walnut, Watseka. <br /><br />KCC staff will help participants prepare scholarship applications for KCC awards, and will help with the  Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The FAFSA is the form used at all two- and four-year colleges and universities to determine eligibility for federal and state grants, work-study programs, subsidized and unsubsidized student loans and some scholarships.<br /><br />Participants should bring completed tax returns or other documents to establish income for 2014 (tax returns do not need to be complete to attend the workshop), a list of any extra-curricular activities (sports, clubs, organizations) the student has participated in during high school, and contact information including email addresses of up to three references who can recommend the student for a scholarship.<br /><br />“Even though KCC’s tuition is a fraction of what four-year colleges and universities cost, for many families it is still a large expense,” said Nancy Schunke, site coordinator. “Fortunately, college costs can be greatly reduced or completely funded through financial aid such as grants, loans, student employment, and scholarships.”<br /><br />For more information or to reserve a seat, contact Schunke at <a href="mailto:nschunke@kcc.edu">nschunke@kcc.edu</a> or phone 815-802-8780.</p>
