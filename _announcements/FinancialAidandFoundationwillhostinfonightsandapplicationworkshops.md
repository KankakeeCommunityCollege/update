<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassD016E9DA1138452E86E3DE5D4C1823C3"><p>A series of Financial Aid Information Nights and Scholarship Application Workshops for the 2015-16 award year.</p>
<p>Faculty and staff are asked to tell students about these opportunities. </p>
<p>Financial Aid Information Sessions are designed to clarify the types of aid available and to help students and their parents understand the steps to obtain financial aid.<br />The dates will be:<br />* Wednesday, Nov. 19, 2014, 6-8 p.m. in Room M120 <br />* Wednesday, Dec. 10, 2014, 4-6 p.m. in Room M120 <br /><br />Open Labs to complete the FAFSA will be held four times. At two of the sessions, in January and February, instruction of filling out <a href="/future/paying/scholarships/Pages/default.aspx">scholarship applications</a> also will be offered.</p>
<p>The dates will be: <br />* Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2015, Room M120; arrive between 6-8 p.m.<br />* Wednesday, Feb. 25, 2015, Room M120, arrive between 4-6 p.m.<br />* Tuesday, March 17, 2015, Room M120, arrive between 6-8 p.m.<br />* Tuesday, April 14, 2015, Room M120, arrive between 4-6 p.m.</p>
<p>Bring the following documents which pertain to you, your spouse and/or your parents for the Open Lab session: <br />* 2014 federal tax returns and W-2 forms. Note: tax returns do not need to be completed and filed in order to attend.<br />* A listing of any other types of untaxed income or benefits received in 2014.<br /><br />The Open Labs are an opportunity to fill out the <a href="http://fafsa.gov/">Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</a> with assistance from financial aid professionals. Many two- and four-year colleges and universities throughout the U.S. require or strongly encourage filling out the FAFSA. The FAFSA is the basis for determining eligibility for federal and state grants, work study programs, some scholarships, and subsidized &amp; unsubsidized student loans.<br /><br />The workshops are held in a KCC computer lab to offer the opportunity to apply online. Students will also see samples of award-winning essays. English professors will be in attendance to assist with the writing section of the scholarship application.</p>
<p>These financial aid sessions are for parents and students of all income levels. The forms discussed are used at all two-year and four-year colleges and universities. Therefore, parents and students are invited regardless of whether they plan to attend KCC.<br /><br />Students can apply online for scholarships through the KCC Foundation between Nov. 1, 2014 and March 1, 2015.</p>
