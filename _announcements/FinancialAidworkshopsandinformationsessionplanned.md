<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>&quot;It is important to complete a FAFSA as soon as possible in the spring semester,&quot; said John Perry, director of financial aid. It does not matter if your child is not sure where he or she will attend college or even if he or she will go to college, John said. &quot;Completing the FAFSA in the spring provides a safety net so when the student's college plans are finalized, it is not too late to receive grants, student loans and scholarships.&quot;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>The FAFSA results allow parents and students time to make their financial plan to pay for college, she said.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>For more information or to reserve seats at the workshop, phone the Office of Financial Aid at ext. 8550. </span></p>
