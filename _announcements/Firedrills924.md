<p>Fire drills have been scheduled for 9:05 a.m. and 5:15 p.m. on Monday, Sept. 24.</p>
<p>All staff should review fire evacuation procedures before the drill.</p>
<p>In order that there is some degree of realism to the drill, faculty should not forewarn students. During the drill, everyone should cooperate to assist students in leaving the building and staying a reasonable distance from the buildings.</p>
