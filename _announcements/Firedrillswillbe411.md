<p>All staff should review fire evacuation procedures before the drill. In order that there is some degree of realism to the drill, faculty should not forewarn students. </p>
<p>During the drill, everyone should cooperate to assist students in leaving the building and staying a reasonable distance from the buildings.</p></div></div>
