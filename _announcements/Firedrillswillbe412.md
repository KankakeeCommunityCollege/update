<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass6637C1BA9FC5448DB0EA6115AC886BD8"><p>â€‹Fire drills are scheduled for 9:10 a.m. and 5:10 p.m. on Tuesday, April 12.</p>
<p>All staff should review fire evacuation procedures before the drill. In order that there is some degree of realism to the drill, faculty should not forewarn students. </p>
<p>During the drill, everyone should cooperate to assist students in leaving the building and staying a reasonable distance from the buildings.<br /><br /></p></div></div>
