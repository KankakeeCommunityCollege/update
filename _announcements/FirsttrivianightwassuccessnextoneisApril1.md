<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassB0AAD94954B945ACAAE3134E79C68F90><div><font size=2>Prairie State Family Trivia Night this past Friday (Jan. 28) was a huge success. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>Ten teams played 10 rounds of trivia. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>The event raised $1,200 to benefit Prairie State Legal Services, the community's provider of low-cost legal services to low-income and senior citizen families. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>Special thanks to Marketing and Media for their publicity and their work with AV setup, especially Kari Sargeant, Stephen Dockemeyer, and Nathan Harrington. As always, our security team of Eric Springer, his crew of student assistants, and Physical Plant got everything looking great in the College Center. Auston Minnich and the FSI team kept everyone well-fed with popcorn and chips and salsa.Â  Thanks, too, to Michelle Driscoll and Joe Lightfoot for helping coordinate refreshments.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>I heard comments all evening about our paralegal students and alumni and how professionally they presented themselves to campus visitors, and if you were there, you saw it, too. They make KCC look good. Thanks to all of them. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>If you couldn't be there, mark your calendars now for the next Trivia Night, April 1 from 6:30 to 9:30 p.m. in the College Center. Cost is $10 per person or a team of six for $50. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>Cash prizes will be awarded to the first- and second-place winning teams. If you have questions, call or e-mail Kris Condon at </font><a href="mailto:kcondon@kcc.edu"><font size=2>kcondon@kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2> or 815-802-8216.<br></font></div></div></div>
