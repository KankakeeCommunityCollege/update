<div>Flex plans are an Internal Revenue Service-approved method of paying for out-of-pocket medical, dental, vision, and over-the-counter expenses with set aside &quot;pre-tax&quot; dollars. </div>
<div><br>There are two types of flex accounts: Health Flexible Spending Account (FSA) and Dependent Care Account (DCA) for child and/or adult dependent day care. Participation is voluntary, but employees must enroll in the plan to receive this benefit. </div>
<div><br>Here's how it works: Money is deducted from your wages before taxes. It is set aside in your flex account. Remaining wages are subject to taxes, but you can save between 20 percent and 30 percent in taxes by not being taxed on the money set aside into the flex plan. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To review which medical expenses would be covered under the flex plan, go to O:\Share\KCC\Flex Spend and click on Enrollment Packet.</div>
<div><br>If interested, please visit the Flexible Spending Accounts presentation at the Employee Benefits Fair on Nov 17.  <br></div></div></div>
