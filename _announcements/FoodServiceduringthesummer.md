<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass8B1994F665044136B961E5AFCC04DB15"><div> </div>
<div>Submitted by Vicki Gardner, vice president for finance and administration</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There has been some confusion about food service during the summer. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Food service hours will be 7:30 a.m. - 1:30 p.m. when the college is open. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Because of the low census count of customers, the number of ‘grab and go’ items is minimized to avoid food loss. However, by phoning ext. 8433, you will reach the food service cashier (our customer-service friendly Tammy) and you can order what you’d like (salads, sandwiches, wraps and more) for the time you’d like. This way food will be made fresh, and your wait time will be minimized.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The full catering menu is available as well, and remember Chef Rob Stelmaszewski's whole pizzas are perfect for your area gatherings.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you have any suggestions or issues with food service, please contact Rob directly at ext. 8430, or visit him in food service if your order needs attention.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks as always for your support of the college’s food service partner, Food Service Incorporated.</div>
