<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass808E9FFA451B4D93B95C0C8343FE13EA"><p>​KCC Foundation scholarship applications are now available at <a href="/scholarships">www.kcc.edu/scholarships</a>. </p>
<p>“Scholarships have made a huge impact in my life,” said Sandra Chavez, a KCC psychology major. “Because of the money that I was awarded, I don’t have to worry about paying for tuition, books and fees. Instead, I can focus on school.”</p>
<p>Chavez, of Gilman, received the GED Recipient Scholarship, the Peg Reeves Scholarship and the Humanities Division Scholarship. </p>
<p>Ryan Dandurand of Grant Park said scholarships have made a difference for him.<br />“I have been able to concentrate on what is really important--my studies,” he said. Dandurand, who is studying to become a flight medic, received the Student Ambassadors Scholarship and the Transfer Student scholarship.</p>
<p>The KCC Foundation offers 106 scholarships for the 2015-16 school year, which begins in August. More than 263 individual awards, valued at more than $200,000, are available to assist in paying for tuition, books and fees.</p>
<p>“Every student should have the opportunity to attend college and achieve their academic goals,” said Aindrea Hogan, coordinator of scholarships and donor relations for the KCC Foundation. “You don’t need to be a 4.0 student to receive the assistance that you need. The KCC Foundation offers scholarships opportunities for virtually every student.”</p>
<p>When submitting the online application, applicants include a narrative as well as names of individuals who can provide letters of recommendation. Data from the applications automatically matches students to scholarships they qualify to receive. A scholarship search mechanism also is available.</p>
<p>The application deadline for 2015-16 KCC Foundation scholarships is Sunday, March 1, 2015.</p>
<p>For more information call Hogan at 815-802-8251 or email <a href="mailto:ahogan@kcc.edu">ahogan@kcc.edu</a>. Complete information also is at <a href="/scholarships">www.kcc.edu/scholarships</a>.<br /></p>
