<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1FDC1F4D38DD49039AD0A35E181DEF95"><p>Jordan Arseneau has been selected as the 2015 KCC Distinguished Alumni Award recipient.</p>
<p>Arseneau came to KCC immediately after high school, and was undecided about which career to pursue. Coming from a single parent household, finances were very limited for him. Arseneau applied for and received a scholarship through KCC’s TRiO Student Support Services program, which helps first generation students. With scholarship support and a part-time job, Arseneau was able to pay for college himself.</p>
<p>His interests were peaked when he took a speech class at KCC. </p>
<p>“I remember thinking, ‘I definitely would like to do something in a communication field,’” Arseneau said. Following this thought, Arseneau attained his associate degree from KCC (speech communications, 2002)<br />and a bachelor’s degree in mass communication from Illinois State University in Bloomington. He has climbed the ranks in broadcasting and now works as a photographer and editor for Tribune Broadcasting. </p>
<p>&quot;I shoot and edit features for an original show called <a href="http://chicagosbesttv.com/">Chicago's Best</a> for CLTV &amp; WGN in Chicago,&quot; Arseneau says on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordanarseneau">his LinkedIn page</a>. &quot;Chicago's Best is a food and lifestyle show highlighting great restaurants in the Chicagoland area. It's hosted by Ted Brunson and Brittney Payton. We all work for Oak Brook Productions, a production wing of Tribune Broadcasting.</p>
<p>&quot;My primary responsibilities are electronic field production for locally produced original shows. This incudes on-location shooting, lighting, and sound recording. When I'm not doing that I'm (FCP) editing shows for broadcast and online distribution.&quot;</p>
<p>Arseneau has been awarded three Emmy awards from the <a href="http://chicagoemmyonline.org/awards/emmy-awards/">Chicago/Midwest Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences</a>.<br /></p>
