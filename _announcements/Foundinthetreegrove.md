<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassA49CA387288947579E110CA395FAD160"><p>A crew from Physical Plant Department recently found a marker for a &quot;Student Grove.&quot;<br /><br />They found it while clearing vegetation in the wooded area alongside College Drive, across from the golf course. The space around the stone is now pretty open, to show the grove was established in January 1977. The marker also says &quot;To recognize those students who have served the College with distinction, this arbor grove is dedicated in their honor.&quot;<br /><br />Near the marker were some tagged pin oaks with student names.<br /><br />Anyone with more information about the grove is welcome to contact George Mateja, coordinator of grounds and horticulture management.<br /><br />Note: The Student Grove is different from the &quot;Student Trustee Grove.&quot;</p></div></div>
