<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass73A198DC27FE4D1A89FC2F2B61B9AC60"><p>Miner Memorial Library staff have removed some music CDs from the collection.</p>
<p>KCC faculty and staff are invited to select a few CDs that will be “free to a good home.” They are being kept at the circulation desk.</p>
<p>&quot;We do ask, however, that you limit your selection to five CDs,&quot; said Barbara Loudy, technician I in the library. &quot;On Nov. 3, if there are any CDs left, we will give students the opportunity to take them as well.&quot;</p>
