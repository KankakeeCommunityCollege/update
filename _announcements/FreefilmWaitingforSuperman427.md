<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass732A6DAC1B2F4AA7973F4F4CAB01AD05"><div>   <font size="2"> Waiting for Superman will be shown at 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. Wednesday, April 27 in KCC's auditorium. <br />    Directed and co-written by Davis Guggenheim, the 2010 documentary explores the state of public education in the U.S. and how it is affecting our children. </font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />    A plot summary from the Sundance Film Festival states: &quot;As he follows a handful of promising kids through a system that inhibits, rather than encourages, academic growth, Guggenheim undertakes an exhaustive review of public education, surveying 'drop-out factories' and 'academic sinkholes,' methodically dissecting the system and its seemingly intractable problems.&quot;</div>
