<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass8808E65D2D2F434BA92DDB3EE0629D5F">
<div>At the request of members of the Supportive Staff Communications Committee, KCC now offers free transcripts to its employees, retirees, and dependent children age 23 and younger.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The fee for transcripts will be waived provided the transcript is being sent to an educational institution.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As a reminder, KCC already offers reduced tuition for an employee’s or retiree’s spouse and dependent children (under age 24). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The student is responsible for other costs associated with the course, such as fees, textbooks, and supplies.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For more information on these two benefits, please contact David Cagle, director of Human Resources, at 815-802-8128. </div>
