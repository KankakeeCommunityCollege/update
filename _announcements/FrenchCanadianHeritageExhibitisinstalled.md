<div>A French Canadian Heritage exhibit has been installed on the third floor near Room L308. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The emphasis is photographs and content related to the French Canadian interview project conducted by former KCC faculty member, James Paul, D.A., and his Western Civilization students from 2000 to 2006. The content was developed by Jim and KCC Professor Steve DePasquale. It was designed by Diane Soltis, a KCC graphic artist. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Overall, the display fosters interest in, and appreciation for, the primary cultural group that settled Kankakee County and the surrounding area. It is 12 feet long and 5 feet tall, and it has interactive features (QR codes). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The project was made possible by donors Bill Dyon, Cecile LaMarre Enright and the Bourbonnais Grove Historical Society.</div>
<div> </div>
