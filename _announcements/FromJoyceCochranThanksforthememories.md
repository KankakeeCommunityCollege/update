<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass842C198DD2C647D899C767E92E1F0C15">
<div>I cannot believe how fast these last three months have gone. In January, I announced my decision to retire at the end of March and <em>the end of March </em>is now here. Unbelievable!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For over 20 years I have been proud to say I work at KCC. I never dreamed when I started back in 1993 that I would still be here some 20 years later. I have worked all those years in Student Services and have watched as numerous friends took the same step that I am about to take. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I feel blessed and honored to call all of you my friends. Many of you have worked closely with me and have offered words of encouragement on days when I needed encouraging. We shared joys and we shared some sorrows as well. It was wonderful to share weddings, births, anniversaries, birthdays, and so much more. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But, here I am and it is time to close this chapter and begin writing a new one. I hope to fill the pages with many exciting things. I am blessed beyond compare and I know those blessings will just keep coming. The next exciting chapter will be filled with simple things as well as adventures and new endeavors. Simple things like making cookies and even cleaning closets, adventures like visiting new places and taking on new challenges, and maybe new endeavors like utilizing my skills and talents where they hopefully will continue to make a difference. And you can count on the fact that most of the pages will be filled with the adventures and the simple things I will be doing with my family. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks to all of you for your kind words best wishes, cards, and gifts that I have received in honor of my retirement. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A big thank you to Dr. Avendano and all of you who planned and prepared my retirement reception on Tuesday. It was wonderful and I enjoyed all the people who came by to congratulate me. </div>
<div>So many people have touched my life here at KCC and I will be forever grateful for the times we have shared together. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Blessings to you all!</div>
