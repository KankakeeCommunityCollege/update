<div><font size="2">Effective Jan. 2, 2014, there will be a new version of the General Educational Development test.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />Although the expiration is a year away, staff of the Kankakee Community College Adult Education Office is encouraging those without a GED to begin preparation and testing immediately.</div>
<div><br />“We offer at least one GED orientation each week,” said Margaret Cooper, assistant dean of adult and community education at KCC. “The orientation and preparation classes are free. But, the price of the GED test goes up in 2014. That’s just one of the reasons to finish the tests by the end of 2013.”</div>
<div><br />It’s easy to see a deadline that’s so far off and think it can wait, said Allen Weaver, coordinator of adult education and GED programs for KCC.</div>
<div><br />“Although there are weekly orientations, class sessions are much less frequent,” Weaver said. “Classes start every two months. There are only five more preparation class sessions before the deadline.</div>
<div><br />“We encourage test-takers to act now to finish and pass before the current test expires because the new test will have a higher cost, and it will be more difficult to pass. Additionally, all current test scores will expire when the new test is implemented. We don’t want any of our GED students to have to start over with the new test.”</div>
<div><br />The new test price is expected to be $130, compared to the current price of $50.</div>
<div><br />KCC has five area locations offering free GED preparation courses. Online preparation courses also are offered. The GED exam assesses academic skills and knowledge typically developed in a four-year high school education program. Passing the GED test is generally considered the equivalent of a high school diploma.</div>
<div><br />Area locations which offer free GED preparation are:<br /> -- KCC, 100 College Drive in Kankakee;<br /> -- KCC Education and Employment Center, 202 N. Schuyler Ave. in Kankakee (the entrance is on Oak Street);<br /> -- KCC Iroquois County Satellite Center, 1001 E. Grant St. in Watseka;<br /> -- First United Methodist Church of Momence, 111 W. Fourth St. in Momence;<br /> -- Bradley Public Library, 296 N. Fulton Ave. in Bradley; and<br /> -- online, with information available at </font><a href="mailto:GEDonline@kcc.edu"><font size="2">GEDonline@kcc.edu</font></a><font size="2">.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />GED preparation courses offered by KCC begin every eight weeks. To participate in the next session, students must register for an orientation on or before Dec. 17. To enroll or for more information, phone 815-802-8300.<br /></font><font size="2"></font></div>

<div><font size="2">The GED is a series of five tests developed and administered by the American Council on Education. The five-test sections are science, social studies, math, language arts reading and language arts writing.  Students must also pass the Illinois and US Constitution exam. The GED is available to those who are 17 years of age or older and who have not graduated from high school. The GED has been offered since 1942. The 2014 test series will be the fifth generation of the test. It replaces the “2002 Series GED test.” The new 2014 GED test will be launched on Jan. 2, 2014.</font></div>
