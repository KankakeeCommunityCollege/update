<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass7640770824B048D7B4F24D1E9F97C86B"><p>​Chris Gardner has been named as interim head men’s basketball coach at Kankakee Community College.<br /><br /><img width="111" height="140" alt="Chris Gardner" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Chris_Gardner_update.jpg" style="height:160px;vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px;width:128px" />Gardner was the assistant coach for KCC during the 2014-15 season. During that campaign, the Cavaliers won the Region IV title and finished the season with a 24-9 record. He replaces Julian Springer who has accepted the athletic director position at Malcolm X College in Chicago.<br /><br />“Coach Gardner was the assistant last season, plus he was actively involved in the recruiting process, so he knows the players and they know him,” said Ted Petersen, athletic director at KCC. “His familiarity should help make the transition seamless. I am both grateful that Coach Springer has such a wonderful career opportunity and for having a talented replacement like Chris available to step in so close to the start of the school year.”<br /><br />Before joining the Cavaliers, Gardner was head coach and assistant director of the Example Sports AAU boys and girls basketball programs in Kankakee. He also has been assistant women's basketball coach at Moraine Valley Community College and head sophomore girls coach at Chicago Vocational Career Academy.<br /><br />A Chicago native, Gardner played basketball at Whitney Young High School, Elgin Community College and Trinity International University in Deerfield. At Elgin, he was an All-Skyway Conference and All-Region IV performer. He also played five years professionally for the Kankakee County Soldiers.<br /><br />KCC will open its 2015-16 season on Nov. 5 with a home game against Trinity Christian College. Cavaliers home games are played in the George H. Ryan Gymnasium at KCC.<br /></p>
