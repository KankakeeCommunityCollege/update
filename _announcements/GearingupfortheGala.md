<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass76B6B21C8E2D44E88C9E17CF69819A80"><p><img alt="50thgalaheading-compressed.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/50thgalaheading-compressed.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />On Saturday, May 20, KCC's Riverfront Campus will be transformed for the Power of Community Gala - a culmination of the 50th anniversary celebration.</p>
<p>The evening will feature locations including the College Center, North Patio and gymnasium. Save the Date cards have been sent to all employees, and invitations also will be coming.</p>
<p>The program emcee will be Dr. Larry Huffman, KCC's president from 1987 until his retirement in 2001. The main event for the night -- a splendid catered dinner --  will be in the gymnasium. A group of 50 Fabulous Alumni will be recognized during the party. This is a last call for <a href="http://fifty.kcc.edu/50-fabulous-alumni/">nominations</a>: they are due March 1.</p>
<p>Entertainment will be from a variety of local talent, including <a href="http://actingouttheatreco.org/">Acting Out Theatre Co.</a>, Dave King Trio and Piano Player Desiree Hays. While dessert and coffee are served, fireworks over the river will cap the festivities. There will be cocktails throughout the evening.</p>
<p>KCC employees, and a guest, can attend for the special rate of $75 per person. This amount covers per-person costs. General admission will be $150 per person.  </p>
<p>Sponsorships are currently being cultivated -- anyone with interest is invited to contact <a href="mailto:kmyers@kcc.edu">Kelly Myers</a>, executive director of the <a href="/foundation/Pages/default.aspx">KCC Foundation</a>.</p>
<p>Proceeds from the event will benefit KCC scholarships and assist KCC students and athletes.</p></div></div>
