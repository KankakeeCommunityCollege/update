<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass0B0E4D23AD95484A8B285FA4717B1945"><p>​The generosity of KCC employees has continued this week during the combined employee giving campaigns.</p>
<p>The campaign for the KCC Foundation has received $14,129 of the $20,000 goal so far. The donation period will continue until Oct. 31. More information on how giving to the Foundation makes a difference is on the <a href="/Foundation/giving/eg/Pages/2014campaign.aspx">campaign web site</a>. The page also has an <a href="/Foundation/giving/eg/Pages/contribute.aspx">online contribution form</a>.</p>
<p>To this point, United Way contributions are at $9,106. The college's United Way goal is $16,000. The United Way campaign will continue for about two more months. The <a href="http://www.myunitedway.org/">United Way of Kankakee and Iroquois County website</a> has more information on the impact of gifts. A KCC <a href="/FacultyStaff/departments/hr/Documents/2014%20United%20Way%20Pledge%20Form.pdf">contribution form</a> also is online.</p>
<p>Fans of moving pictures can <a href="/Foundation/giving/eg/Pages/default.aspx">watch the video</a> about the combined campaign.</p>
<p>&quot;It is important to support the community as well as our own institution,&quot; said Dr. John Avendano, KCC's president. &quot;KCC is a special institution that values the students and the community that we serve. Let’s show everyone what KCC is all about. Together we can make a difference. Your gift, regardless of size, is important and greatly appreciated.&quot;</p>
<p>Thank you to everyone for your generosity.</p>
