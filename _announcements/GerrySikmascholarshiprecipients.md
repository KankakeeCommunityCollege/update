<p>The scholarship winners, Kinsey Knauth of Watseka and Amanda Shortsleeve of Donovan, each will receive full-ride agriculture scholarships to attend KCC during the 2013-14 year. The scholarships, valued at $5,000 each, are funded by Shoup Manufacturing of Kankakee and administered by the KCC Foundation.</p></div>
<div><br />A U.S. Census on Agriculture report shows trends toward women in farming. As of 2007, there are more than 1 million women who farm, an increase of 19 percent between 2002 and 2007. Regarding farms both owned and operated by women, they accounted for 14 percent of all farms in 2007. That number was up from 11 percent in 2002. In Iroquois County, where both recipients live, less than 10 percent of farms are owned and operated by women.</div>
<div><br />Female or not, getting a scholarship makes a difference for these students.</div>
<div><br />“This scholarship will really impact my financial need and my life right now,” said Knauth. “Being able to know that when I wake up in the morning I get to go outside and see all of our cattle and crops is a big part of my life. That is why I want to continue learning more about the agriculture industry. I have worked on our farm my whole life and would love to follow in my dad's footsteps.”</div>
<div><br />Knauth’s family has 1,000 head of cattle and 1,200 acres, growing corn, beans, wheat and alfalfa.</div>
<div><br />Shortsleeve assists at her family farm, with 220 acres of corn and beans.</div>
<div><br />“It's a small family farm that I love to call my home!” she said. “I like helping people and this is a way to do that. I enjoy learning about the crops and the different varieties of seed that we use to get the optimal genetic makeup and yields. I especially enjoy working with the equipment.</div>
<div><br />“I never dreamed that I'd ever receive a scholarship,” she said. “I feel very fortunate and determined to make the best of this great opportunity. (The scholarship is) a reminder that there are people out there looking out for your career field. Not many people pay attention to agriculture anymore.”</div>
<div><br />“We are located in a largely agricultural region, and we recognize that agriculture has a significant impact on the lives of the families who live in this area,” said Ray Lovell, president and owner of Shoup Manufacturing Company. “In choosing scholarship recipients, we wanted students who were excited to pursue a degree in agricultural studies and continue on to have agriculture play a role in their daily lives. A passion for farming and the joy that being on the farm brings were obvious when talking to both Kinsey and Amanda.”</div>
<div><br />“I think that by continuing working on the farm I can impact the agriculture industry,” Knauth said. “Having a feedlot and continuing to make it larger is a good way to help the agriculture industry.”</div>
<div><br />“I am confident both students will continue to be a great asset to the agriculture industry,” said Katelynn Ohrt, director of the agriculture program at the college. “I look forward to building the agriculture program and developing great partnerships within the community, like our partnership with Shoup Manufacturing. Shoup Manufacturing provided these recipients with an opportunity they will not forget and I cannot thank them enough.”</div>
<div><br />The scholarship is named for Gerry Sikma, who worked for Shoup Manufacturing from 1988 until his death in 2008. He also was a grain farmer.</div>
<div><br />“Gerry Sikma was a man of great integrity and character. He was devoted to his family and dedicated to helping run his family farm,” Lovell said. “He brought that same passion and integrity to Shoup on a daily basis. It is a privilege to fund a scholarship in Gerry’s honor. The Gerry Sikma Scholarship will help bring the students in KCC’s district the same opportunity that Gerry had, the ability to pursue a degree in agriculture.”</div>
<div><br />The KCC Associate in Science degree in Agriculture is a transfer program which satisfies the requirements of the first two years of a bachelor’s degree in agriculture. Coursework in the program includes three courses related to agriculture as well as general education classes.
