<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass857FF6B33F434CD9A2871596719513E3"><div><br />The Miner Memorial Library is participating in two projects that expand the number of e-books available to KCC faculty, staff and students.</div>
<div><br />One source the library is using is EBL eBook, a collection of approximately 29,000 academic related titles. It is funded by the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois. </div>
<div><br />The other source is E-Read Illinois, used by more than 300 libraries throughout Illinois, including KCC. It is a two-year project supported by the Secretary of State’s office through the Illinois State Library, and includes 10,000 titles (predominately popular materials).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Items from both collections can be downloaded to a desktop or a variety of e-reader devices. A subject guide <a href="http://kcc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=602815&amp;sid=4974429">“E-Books from the Miner Memorial Library”</a> has been created with links to each collection and instructions on how to access and download. The guide also is under the subject guide button on the <a href="/library">library’s homepage</a>.  </div>
<div><br />Please contact the library at 815-802-8400 with any comments or questions.<br /></div>
