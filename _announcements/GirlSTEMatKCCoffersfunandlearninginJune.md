<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass60641BDB49BA41AB8A8A1F853F65408B"><p>​Kankakee Community College is launching an exciting new program called GirlSTEM to expose girls to careers that revolve around science, technology, engineering and math.<br /><br />GirlSTEM will have fun, yet educational courses this summer. Classes will be held at KCC for girls entering 5th through 8th grades. The goal of the program is to increase the number of females pursuing science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) careers.<br /><br /><img alt="Nicor donation to GirlSTEM" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Nicor_donation_update.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />The GirlSTEM program received start-up funding from Nicor Gas, a longtime partner of KCC providing workforce development dollars for numerous initiatives. In part, the startup funding from Nicor Gas will be we used to provide scholarships for girls whose families can’t afford to pay the tuition cost.  Left to right in the photo Bernard Anderson, manager of Community Relations &amp; Economic Development for Nicor, Mary Posing, KCC assistant dean of continuing education and career services; John Avendano, KCC president; and Michael Boyd, KCC vice president for instruction and student success.<br /><br />“When we began GirlSTEM discussions, we knew Nicor Gas would be a great partner,” said Mary Posing, KCC’s assistant dean of continuing education and career services. “They play a significant role in our local community and are active participants in several Illinois workforce boards supporting education and benefitting youth.”<br /><br />“We know that a strong future starts with a solid educational foundation,” said Bernie Anderson, community relations and economic development manager for Nicor Gas. “We are proud to support GirlSTEM and its work to cultivate the analytical and critical thinking skills necessary for a career in the energy sector.”<br /><br />In addition to Nicor Gas, CSL Behring and several area industries and school districts have partnered with KCC to provide instructors, supplies and curriculum. <br /><br />“This is really a win-win opportunity for all those involved, and this program will be a great opportunity for the young girls in our community,” said Posing.<br /><br />For more information about GirlSTEM, scholarship opportunities or to receive program information, visit http://www.kcc.edu/girlstem or contact Erica Billington, <a href="mailto:ebillington@kcc.edu">ebillington@kcc.edu </a>or 815-802-8206.<br /></p>
