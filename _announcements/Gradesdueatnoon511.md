<div><font color="#993300"><strong>Final processes for the semester depend on timeliness <br /></strong></font></div>
<div><font color="#000080"><strong>Submitted by</strong> the Office of Admissions and Registration <br /></font></div>
<div>The Office of Admissions and Registration would like to remind faculty that it is critical that grades are submitted on time by noon May 11 in order to properly serve students, in particular, those who are graduating. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Office of Admissions and Registration has to complete a number of processes, which takes several hours, including one to determine which students receive silver or gold cords at graduation. In addition, the processes show some students if they need a summer course, and determines the names on the President's and Honor's lists.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you for all that you have done to help our students achieve their goals. Please help us with this final step in the process to bring Spring 2012 to a successful completion. <br /></div>
