<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass80DA359F74B14A05954D28E6B9FE234D"><p>​More than 400 people will graduate at the 46th annual KCC commencement ceremony at 10 a.m. Saturday, May 16 in the George H. Ryan Gymnasium in the college's Activities Building.</p>
<p>A number of students, faculty and alumni accomplishments will be recognized. Ray LaHood, former U.S. Secretary of Transportation, will be the speaker.</p>
<p>The ceremony will be broadcast live on <a href="/wkcc">WKCC 91.1 FM</a>. It also will stream live at <a href="http://www.wkccradio.org/">www.wkccradio.org/</a> and a webcast will be shown on the <a href="http://www/kcc.edu">KCC website</a>. The <a href="/students/academics/commencement/Pages/commencement.aspx">2015 graduation page</a> has even more information.</p>
<p>Everyone is invited to share a message on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23kccgrad2015">#kccgrad2015</a> to share best wishes with graduates, or to tweet thoughts and observations during the ceremony.</p>
<p>Two students will be honored as members of the All-Illinois Academic Team, a special recognition based on outstanding academic performance and service to the college and community. They are Nicole Avendano of Bourbonnais, who will receive an Associate in Science transfer degree in Biological Sciences; and Shavez Rosenthal of Kankakee, who will receive an Associate in Arts Degree in Political Science.</p>
<p>Mary Steichen, professor of speech communications in the Humanities and Social Sciences Division, and Ron Shank, adjunct professor in the Humanities and Social Sciences Division, will receive the KCC Outstanding Faculty Member Awards for 2015.</p>
<p>Jordan Arseneau, a three-time Emmy-award winner, will be honored as the college’s 2015 Distinguished Alumnus Award winner.</p>
<p>Arseneau comes from a single parent household, and—along with his twin brother—knew he would be responsible for paying for his own education. Arseneau earned an associate degree from KCC in 2002 and a bachelor’s degree in mass communications from Illinois State University in 2004. He now works as a photographer and editor at Tribune Broadcasting, where his main assignment is for the food show “Chicago’s Best.” He has received three Emmy awards from the Chicago/Midwest Chapter of the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences, in 2011, 2013 and 2014.</p>
<p>“I firmly believe that KCC is the best educational option in Kankakee County,” Arseneau said. “The education and career guidance I received in my short time there was instrumental in my success. I wouldn’t be where I am today without Kankakee Community College.”</p>
<p>LaHood, the commencement speaker, is a senior policy advisor for the law firm of DLA Piper. Though not a lawyer, LaHood uses his 36 years of experience in public service to help clients. He served as the 16th Department of Transportation Secretary from 2009 to 2013, where he oversaw the air, maritime and surface transportation agency, including more than 55,000 employees and a $70 billion budget.</p>
<p>From 1995 to 2009, LaHood was a congressman representing the 18th District of Illinois. He also was chief of staff to U.S. House Minority Leader Robert Michel from 1982 to 1994. </p>
<p>“I know he’s always been a very strong supporter of education and very much a supporter of community colleges around the entire country,” said KCC's president, Dr. John Avendano.</p>
<p>The ceremony will last about an hour, and wristbands given to graduates will be required for admission to the gymnasium. For guests needing assistance or special accommodations, gymnasium doors will open at 8:45 a.m. General seating begins at 9 a.m. Doors to the gymnasium close at 9:55 a.m. or when seating capacity is reached. </p>
