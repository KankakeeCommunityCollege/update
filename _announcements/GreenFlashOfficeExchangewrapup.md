<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass3D42EA68A9CD444AA38CD5F485A13C8E><div><font size=2>    Lots of surplus office supply materials were brought to Room L279 and placed on large tables Thursday April 21 and Friday, April 22.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    Materials were available to any KCC personnel to take and use for their work. At the start of the event, there was enough to cover four tables. Items up for exchange were folders, three-ring binders, paper clips, paper punches, rulers, hanging files, pens, markers, small bulletin boards, desk organizers, tape, computer disks, computer stands, and more. </div>
<div><br>    The photos show the items which were available, <br> <img alt="Office Exchange 1" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/office-exchange-1sm_web.JPG"> <img alt="Office Exchange 2" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/office-exchange-2sm_web.JPG"> <img alt="Office Exchange 3" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/office-exchange-3sm_web.JPG">         <br>                                       <br>and what was left at the end: about four boxes went to recycling or--for a very small portion--to the dumpster.                              <br> </font></div>
<div><font size=2>Items left at the end <img alt="Office Exchange left" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/office-exchange-4-left-sm_web.JPG"><br> <br>    &quot;A good time was had by all and many treasures were rescued from storage or worse yet, the trash bin,&quot; said Rich Schultz, coordinator of sustainability. &quot;Good job everyone! We'll do this again next year.</font></div>
<div><font size=2><br>    &quot;These photos only capture some of the materials exchanged. Most who brought in things to leave took other stuff away, so it was hard to get the full extent of how much changed hands during the event.&quot;</font></div>
