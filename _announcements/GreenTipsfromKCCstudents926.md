<div>Green Tips are being presented each week by students in Kristen Larson’s Environmental Biology classes. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Kristen encourages her students to think about sustainability <br>issues and each student must present a “Green Tip” to their class as part of the course.</div>

<div>“Don’t throw away unused coupons. Sent them to ‘Coupons for Troops’ also known as Troopons. This is an organization that gives coupons to troops. This is less wasteful and helps the troops at the same time. You can find more information at <a href="http://www.supportourtroops.org">www.supportourtroops.org</a>.” –- Alisha Brady<br></div>
<div>&quot;Home building or remodeling? Install windows on the east and west side of the building to take advantage of prevailing winds. Also, tailor your roofing tiles to your climate to be more efficient with your heating and cooling.&quot; -- Andrew Bruno</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;Clean your dryer’s lint filter after every drying cycle. This actually saves you energy because the dryer can dry your items better. Also, use rechargeable batteries whenever possible.&quot; -- Katey Burns</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;Always unplug your electronics when not in use. Even if they are turned off they still use electricity.&quot; -- Brandon Denton</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;Instead of using a casket for the deceased, which is not environmentally friendly, there is a new product called an EcoPod. It is a casket made from 100% environmentally friendly materials. <a href="http://www.ecopod.co.uk">www.ecopod.co.uk</a>.&quot; -- Zachary Domin</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;Put timers on your lights. This will lower the chance that you will forget to turn them off and this saves energy. Motion sensory lights and solar powered lights also save electricity.&quot; -- Sharon Domont</div>
<div> </div>
<div>More Green Tips will be added periodically in the online <em>Update</em>!<br></div>
