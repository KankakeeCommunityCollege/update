<div>Following is information taken from a final grant report submitted by Scott Stewart, Ph.D., director of KCC horticulture and agriculture programs.<br><br>KCC has made good use of a $1,000 Illinois Department of Natural Resources Rain Garden grant. The Horticulture Program used the funds to design and install an 800 square foot rain garden adjacent to the Horticulture Teaching Greenhouse. The rain garden helped achieve three goals: <br><br>-- Create a location to divert, hold, and filter rainwater from the roof of the greenhouse facility away from storm water sewer,<br><br>-- Establish a teaching and demonstration area that promotes sustainable landscape design concepts, and <br><br>-- Convert a turfgrass dominated area into a naturalistic community. <br><br>Under the direction of Scott Stewart--and with the assistance of 19 horticulture students, members of the Physical Plant Grounds Department, and other volunteers--all three goals were accomplished. Sixty hours were devoted to planning, site preparation, and planting of the college's first rain garden. Students and members of the Grounds Department learned about the role and function of rain gardens in landscapes and their input was used to help design the garden. Their ideas had particular impact on the shape and layout of the garden. The project demonstrated a level of integration between the academic and operational sides of the college. <br><br>Installation of a rain garden was the initial step in the horticulture teaching garden's master plan. It was installed as part of the Fundamentals of Horticulture course. Students from the Greenhouse Operations course were responsible for care of the plant plugs prior to their installation in the rain garden. Future horticulture courses will continue to use and maintain the rain garden as the garden becomes an integral part of the college's horticulture curriculum. <br><br>For example, students in Landscape Layout and Design will use the rain garden to learn about integrating functional and naturalistic landscape elements into residential and commercial landscape settings, and students in Basic Soils will use the garden to learn about the biology of wetland and water inundated soils. <br><br>Questions?
