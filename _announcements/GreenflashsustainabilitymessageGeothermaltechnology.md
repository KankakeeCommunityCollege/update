<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass57C2197DBF684393AB5BCEC415EF8C4A><div><font size=2><strong>From: </strong>Rich Schultz, coordinator of Sustainability Center, sustainability &amp; planning </font></div>
<div><font size=2></font> </div>
<div><font size=2>Here’s information on home energy efficiency from Mike Holmes of the “Holmes on Homes” TV program:<br>Getting a quick return on your investment when trying to incorporate “green” concepts into your home design or upgrade projects can be a challenge.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>It’s tough to find ideas that give a good return and can be utilized in any home. Geothermal technology is one such choice.</div>
<div><br>The earth maintains a year-round temperature of about 50 to 55 degrees Fahrenheit at 4 to 6 feet below the surface. Geothermal systems make use<br>of this resource by circulating a fluid through tubing coils or loops which absorb heat from the ground in winter or disperse heat into the ground during the warmer months. Think about it: in the winter, the air<br>temperature outside may be 20 degrees. If you want your home to be 68 degrees, you can tap into the earth’s 50 degree temperature and your heating system only needs to warm the air 18 degrees. In the summer, it may be 85 degrees or higher outside. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To maintain a comfortable 76 degrees inside, bringing the underground temperature to cool your home requires much less energy than trying to cool the hot outside air. </div>
<div><br>The upfront costs to install geothermal systems are higher than for “conventional” heating and cooling systems. But, systems reliability is very good and maintenance costs are minimal. And, heating and cooling costs on a geothermal system can be as much as 70 percent less! The reduced energy costs lead to a relatively quick payback on your investment. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The geological conditions of the site, space availability, complexity of the system, etc. all have an impact on the cost and resulting savings, but geothermal systems are a viable option almost everywhere.</div>
