<div>The retirement party on June 19th meant a lot to me. The retirement plaque, food, flowers and music were tops! (Vicki G. thanks for scaring a lot of people, including me, with the &quot;stats&quot; you so aptly came up with.)  It was a joyous time and made my anticipated departure a little less sad. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want to thank everyone at KCC for the cards, well wishes, gifts and messages.<br /></div>
<div>To my friends in the Physical Plant Department ... thanks for the great send off on June 28th. You all went through a lot of much appreciated work on what we thought then was the hottest day of the year. (Rich, you hold up real well as a cook in hot weather.) Couldn't have asked for a better time. I have enjoyed working with all of you. <br /></div>
<div>I will treasure all thoughts of my 33 years at KCC. I will miss each and everyone.</div>
<div><br />Thanks for memories!<br /></div>
<div>- Vicky Dubie</div>
