<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass0884A6279A8B449FB8A68D33A9314B40"><p>​<img width="358" height="268" alt="KCC 2015 Strategy Forum team" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/2015%20Strategy%20Forum.jpg" style="height:221px;vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px;width:294px" />When it comes to accreditation, the challenges can be rewarding. At least that’s what some of the faculty and staff said who attended the AQIP Strategy Forum Feb. 18-20 in St. Charles.  <br /><br />KCC's team reflected on a number of the college’s successes while preparing for the forum, part of the college’s accreditation process. Sucesses which made an impact include the Leadership Development Program, New Employee Orientation, the strategic planning process, the Employee Satisfaction Inventory, assessment of general education outcomes, and the auto-award process. <br /><br />“Strategy planning is exciting,” said Dr. Michael Boyd, vice president for instruction and student success. “It helps us realize that we’re getting better and we are doing it as a team. Over the past 12 years, data has become a factor in decision making and assessment of institutional effectiveness. Campus stakeholders are now familiar with AQIP, and it’s become part of our culture. <br /><br />“There’s always room to grow. Going forward, we’re going to communicate with each other better, and celebrate our successes together.”<br /><br />The strategy forum team included Dr. John Avendano, Dr. Michael Boyd, Dr. Jill Channing, Jessica Corbus, Dr. Kris Condon, Dr. Purva DeVol and Kenneth Mager. <br /><br />AQIP stands for Academic Quality Improvement Program, and is a pathway leading to reaffirmation of accreditation with the Higher Learning Commission, which accredits degree-granting post-secondary educational institutions in 19 states, including Illinois.<br /></p>
