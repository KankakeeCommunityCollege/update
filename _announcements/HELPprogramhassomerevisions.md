<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass3ACDCE60E9874598AF83B6C476AD4F9F"><p style="color:blue"><em>​</em><span style="color:darkred"><em>Submitted by David Cagle, director of human resources</em></span></p>
<p>At the June 8, 2015 board of trustees meeting, the board approved revisions to the Health Emergency Leave Program (H.E.L.P.) policy. </p>
<p>The program was originally intended to be for the employee only who has a catastrophic medical condition. It is now expanded to include a member of the employee’s immediate household or of the employee’s immediate family for whom the participant is the primary care giver.</p>
<p>We hope that with the revision, we will have greater participation in the program. To join the program, please complete the HELP Program Participant Enrollment Form (O/Share/KCC/Human Resources/Benefits Enrollment folder/HELP Programs &amp; Forms).</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>Detailed H.E.L.P. program information </strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue"></span>This program is established to alleviate the effects of catastrophic medical conditions (serious illness or accident) and provides sick leave days donated by co-workers. It may provide a bridge of paid time before the beginning of the SURS disability program. </p>
<p>To enroll in the program, employees must donate one sick leave day to be effective either July 1 or during the first 30 days of full-time employment; an enrollment form is completed by the employee and submitted to the director of human resources. One sick leave day will be assessed each subsequent July 1. An additional levy may be assessed if the total of available days drops below 16 days. </p>
<ol><li>The program is available for full-time supportive staff and administrators.</li>
<li>Days may be requested only by program participants.</li>
<li>The program is for participants’ health needs or a member of the immediate household or of the employee’s immediate family for whom the participant is the primary care giver. The following are generally considered immediate family members: spouse, children, parents, grandparents, grandchildren, mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother, sister, brother-in-law, sister-in-law, spouse’s grandparents, or same existing step relationships of the immediate family member or member of the immediate household.</li>
<li>A request form is completed, including confirmation from a licensed physician. Requests will be stated in days, which are eight hours.</li>
<li>All paid sick leave, vacation time, and compensatory time (as applicable) must be exhausted by the employee prior to the distribution of days.</li>
<li>In general, the number of days which may be allotted are based on longevity of program participation, as well as any prior use from last allotment, if applicable:<br />0-2 years participation, maximum of 15 days per year; <br />3-5 years participation, maximum of 20 days per year; <br />6-10 years participation, maximum of 25 days per year; <br />11 or more years participation, maximum of 30 days per year.</li>
<li>A member of the Communications Committee who is participating in the program, the director of human resources, and the vice president for finance and administration evaluates each request.</li>
<li>Within two business days of the meeting, the director of human resources will notify the employee of the results.</li>
<li>The director of human resources will administer the program.</li>
<li>Program participants will receive their regular rate of earnings while utilizing approved HELP days.</li></ol>
<p> </p>
<p>A participant may drop out of the program and re-join. The longevity of program participation would include the years of previous participation prior to departure from the program.</p>
