They will then assess the redesign and make changes based on assessment data. The outcome indicators will be the following as compared to before the redesign:<br /><br />● Developmental students spending less time in developmental sequences<br />● Developmental students achieving more successful grade point averages <br />● Developmental students completing degrees or certificates at a higher rate<br /></p>
