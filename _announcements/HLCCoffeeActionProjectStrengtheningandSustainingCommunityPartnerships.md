<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassA6DD4082262D45528C00827897DB6206"><p><span style="color:blue"><em>This is the 11th in a weekly series on KCC's Comprehensive Quality Review and Accreditation. Reviewers from the Higher Learning Commission accrediting agency will visit KCC Feb. 15-17.<br /></em></span><br />The Higher Learning Commission (HLC) requires AQIP institutions to have a minimum of three Action Projects to be updated and reviewed each year describing the progress of the project. </p>
<p>This week we will highlight Strengthening and Sustaining Community Partnerships:</p>
<p>Project leaders – Mary Posing and Ken Crite <br />Team members - Kim Brands, Sheri Cagle, Jessica Corbus, Cari Stevenson, Mark Stevenson, Michael Miller, Jennifer Martin, Chris Young, Paul Carlson, Dwayne Musick, Mark Anderson, Kari Nugent, Kelly Myers, Sheri Cagle</p>
<p>Community partnerships are integral to the success of a community college, and in an effort to strengthen these partnerships KCC initiated four coordinated projects:</p>
<ul><li>Create an employer database shared across KCC departments. The employer database is complete and is being utilized by various KCC staff members.</li>
<li>Create an employer survey to determine industry need. The employer survey was completed. Employer concerns were soft skills and supervisory development. As a result, the Leadership Management Institute was developed and kicked of Wednesday, Jan. 27. There are 12 individuals registered. Topics include: a career personality inventory, communicating for success, delegation, driving change, influencing others, fostering innovation, coaching and goal setting.</li>
<li>Enhance advisory committees to strengthen programs and industry. An Advisory Meeting guide is being developed and a draft will be finished Feb. 15; the final version will be available April 30. </li>
<li>Create an internship procedure. An internship procedure is established. The process and marketing materials will be posted to the web.</li></ul>
