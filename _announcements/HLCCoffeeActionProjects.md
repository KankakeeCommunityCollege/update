<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass74EFCCBB552E458DB16E374AC93AE23C"><p><em style="color:blue">​</em><em style="color:blue">This is the ninth in a weekly series on KCC's Comprehensive Quality Review and Accreditation. Reviewers from the Higher Learning Commission accrediting agency will visit KCC Feb. 15-17.</em></p>
<p>HLC Action Projects – the Higher Learning Commission requires institutions to have a minimum of three Action Projects to be updated and reviewed each year describing the progress of the project. <br />The <a href="/Community/Collegeinfo/ie/aqip/Pages/action-projects.aspx">three current Action Projects </a>are:</p>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>1. </strong>Enhancing Institutional Results Through Informed Decision Making.</span>  <br />Project leader Purva DeVol</p>
<p>This project focuses our institutional efforts toward consolidating the current strategic initiatives related to institutional effectiveness, expanding them, and providing data to be used for decision-making across the college. The project in improving methods to measure effectiveness will complete early this spring, and has thus far resulted in the development of:</p>
<ul><li>A <span style="color:#000000"><span>glossary of key definitions</span> </span>for postsecondary related terms used in the collection and dissemination of research data.</li>
<li>An <span style="color:blue"><span style="color:#000000">institutional effectiveness website</span> </span>that consolidates our initiatives into one user-friendly site </li>
<li>A <span style="color:blue"><span style="color:#000000">data request form</span> </span>for addressing information requests</li>
<li>A <span style="color:#000000">College-wide scorecard</span>, along with scorecards for all five leadership divisions. </li></ul>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>2. </strong>Redesigning developmental education structure, curriculum, and pedagogy.</span> <br />Project leaders – Frederick Cooper and Jennifer Huggins </p>
<p>To improve structure, curriculum and pedagogy within developmental education, KCC researched best practices, streamlined curricula, created an effective scheduling framework, and developed assessment metrics. During the 2015-16 academic year, three departments will launch redesigned developmental programs. They will assess the redesign and make changes based on assessment data. The following outcome indicators in the two programs will be compared:</p>
<ul><li>Developmental students spending less time in developmental sequences</li>
<li>Developmental students achieving higher grade point averages</li>
<li>Developmental students completing degrees or certificates at a higher rate</li></ul>
<p><span style="color:blue"><strong>3. </strong>Strengthening and sustaining community partnerships.</span> <br />Project leader – Mary Posing <br />Community Partnerships are integral to the success of a community college. To strengthen these partnerships, KCC initiated four coordinated projects:</p>
<ul><li>Create an employer database shared across KCC departments</li>
<li>Create an employer survey to determine industry needs</li>
<li>Enhance advisory committees to strengthen programs and industry</li>
<li>Create an internship procedure</li></ul>
<p><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/feedback1.gif" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />Please send any comments/feedback on what you find most interesting or most influential to <a href="mailto:pdevol@kcc.edu">Dr. Purva DeVol</a>, director of institutional research. Those submitting feedback will be placed in a monthly drawing to win a gift certificate to Hammes Cafe which can be used for a Starbucks coffee or other drink. </p>
