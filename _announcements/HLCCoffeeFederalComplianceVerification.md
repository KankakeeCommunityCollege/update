<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC96FC7341E394221979095435C0209AD"><p><span style="color:darkblue"><em>This is the fifth in a weekly series on KCC's Comprehensive Quality Review and Accreditation. Reviewers from the Higher Learning Commission accrediting agency will visit KCC Feb. 15-17.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color:darkblue"></span>What happens during the Comprehensive Quality Review in February? In the next few weeks various areas of the visit will be detailed.</p>
<p>KCC will have a ‘Resource Room” with copies of Federal Compliance documents, so the team of peer reviewers may affirm the accuracy of the information they received prior to the visit. Documents will include those detailing the most recent default rates of student loans, any default reduction plans to assist students, KCC’s program responsibilities under Title IV (including campus crime information, graduation rates, etc), and any results of financial or compliance audits and program reviews.</p>
<p><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/feedback1.gif" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />Please send any comments/feedback on what you find most interesting or most influential to <a href="mailto:pdevol@kcc.edu">Dr. Purva DeVol</a>, director of institutional research. Those submitting feedback will be placed in a monthly drawing to win a gift certificate to Hammes Cafe which can be used for a Starbucks coffee or other drink. </p></div></div>
