<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass2A0EBD4E2DC64F5E872F6E8A537059A7"><p><em style="color:darkblue">This is the sixth in a weekly series on KCC's Comprehensive Quality Review and Accreditation. Reviewers from the Higher Learning Commission accrediting agency will visit KCC Feb. 15-17.</em></p>
<p>Before the visit by the Higher Learning Commission in February, the team of peer reviewers will identify eight to 12 items from the Systems Portfolio to verify, and will identify a strategy (whom to interview, what records to inspect, etc.) to resolve these questions. </p>
<p>During the visit, they will conduct spot-checks, and summarize findings using a form provided by the Academic Quality Improvement Program, a copy of which will be discussed with KCC. A major goal of this component of the visit is to provide KCC with information that enables the college to modify its Systems Portfolio to be a more effective, more credible, better-understood presentation of KCC's processes and performance results.</p>
<p>This series of updates was created with the goal of expanding your knowledge of college information and processes, not just for the Comprehensive Quality Review in February, but year-round.</p>
<p><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/feedback1.gif" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />Please send any comments/feedback on what you find most interesting or most influential to <a href="mailto:pdevol@kcc.edu">Dr. Purva DeVol</a>, director of institutional research. Those submitting feedback will be placed in a monthly drawing to win a gift certificate to Hammes Cafe which can be used for a Starbucks coffee or other drink.</p>
