<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass4C30D3A650194560A8DDEA1C43E22888"><p>​<span style="color:blue"><em>This is the eighth in a weekly series on KCC's Comprehensive Quality Review and Accreditation. Reviewers from the Higher Learning Commission accrediting agency will visit KCC Feb. 15-17.<br /></em></span><br /><span style="color:darkblue">Organizational Quality Commitment</span><br />The team of peer reviewers will have a variety of occasions to interact with personnel from KCC to assess the strength and direction of the College’s commitment to systematic quality improvement, and answer KCC’s questions about processes and expectations of AQIP and the HLC. <br /><br />There should be at least one public meeting to which administrators, faculty, staff, students, and other constituencies are invited, at which the team of peer reviewers make a short explanatory presentation about the most recent and the next steps in KCC’s involvement in AQIP and answer questions. (Separate sessions can be scheduled for specific groups, or groups can be mixed in larger sessions. An agenda for the sessions will be available next month.) <br /><br />The result of this segment of the visit is a commentary, by the evaluators, on the strength and momentum of KCC’s commitment to AQIP, and suggestions on how KCC may improve that commitment.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkblue">Accreditation Issue Follow-up</span><br />This involves a formal review with College leaders of the Accreditation Issues Analysis received by the organization as part of its last Systems Appraisal. <br /><br />The goal is to make certain that KCC has understood all issues raised by the Analysis and has either rectified them or is taking affirmative action to correct problems prior to its next scheduled Reaffirmation of Accreditation.  <br /><br /></p>
