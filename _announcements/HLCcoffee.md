<p>Accreditation - Colleges and universities voluntarily seek accreditation from non-governmental bodies to ensure that the education provided by them meets acceptable levels of quality. There are two types of educational accreditation: institutional and specialized. <strong>Accreditation affects all of us</strong>.</p>
<p>Higher Learning Commission - The <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/About-the-Commission/about-hlc.html">Higher Learning Commission</a> (HLC) is one of six regional institutional accreditors in the U.S. HLC accredits degree-granting post-secondary educational institutions in the North Central region, which includes Illinois and 18 other states.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, more information will be available regarding HLC, the Comprehensive Quality Review, Action Projects and the role each employee has in all of it. There also will be an opportunity to provide feedback and enter a monthly drawing to win a Starbucks coffee certificate.<br /></p></div></div>
