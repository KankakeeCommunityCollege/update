<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassF31212536041484FB254B767958E7939"><p><em style="color:darkblue">​</em><em style="color:darkblue">This is the second in a weekly series on KCC's Comprehensive Quality Review and Accreditation. Reviewers from the Higher Learning Commission accrediting agency will visit KCC Feb. 15-17.</em><br /><br />The <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/11-9-2015%20Quality%20Highlights%20Report.pdf">Quality Highlights Report</a> is a 7-10 page report required by the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) for the Comprehensive Quality Review that will take place Feb. 15-17, 2016.</p>
<p>The Quality Highlights Report describes:</p>
<ul><li>Major changes and improvements KCC has made since its last Systems Appraisal and February 2015 Strategy Forum (e.g., where the new Action Project came out of)</li>
<li>How our Systems Portfolio has been used since the last Systems Appraisal</li>
<li>Our commitment to continuous improvement (so the panel can determine whether KCC is seriously committed to quality improvement)</li>
<li>Other factors the AQIP Review Panel on Reaffirmation should weigh in making its recommendation.  <a href="mailto:pdevol@kcc.edu"></a></li></ul>
<p>This draft of the Quality Highlights Report has been reviewed by several committees, but more feedback is needed before it is submitted to the Higher Learning Commission in December.</p>
<p><a href="mailto:pdevol@kcc.edu"><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/feedback1.gif" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" /></a>Please review the report and send any comments/feedback on what you find most interesting or most influential to <a href="mailto:pdevol@kcc.edu">Dr. Purva DeVol</a>, director of institutional research. Those submitting feedback will be placed in a monthly drawing to win a gift certificate to Hammes Cafe which can be used for a Starbucks coffee or other drink.<br /></p></div>
