<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass2C1559E1698F414182A46056181804A9"><p><em style="color:blue"> This is the seventh in a weekly series on KCC's Comprehensive Quality Review and Accreditation. Reviewers from the Higher Learning Commission accrediting agency will visit KCC Feb. 15-17.</em><br /><br /><span style="color:#000000">In combination with the Strategy Forum and Action Projects -- which drive concrete improvement activities -- the Systems Portfolio and Systems Appraisal are a means of taking stock of the college’s continuous improvement.<br /><br />The Systems Appraisal is based on a Systems Portfolio which covers the <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/Pathways/aqip-categories.html">six AQIP Categories</a>. It describes processes, results, and improvement in each system, and shows evidence that the institution continues to meet HLC's <a href="https://www.hlcommission.org/Criteria-Eligibility-and-Candidacy/criteria-and-core-components.html">five Criteria for Accreditation</a>. <br /><br />The Systems Portfolio presents an overview of the institution, and answers explicitly all of the questions under each of the six AQIP Categories.<br /><br />AQIP calls upon institutions to undergo a Systems Appraisal every four years as a formal review of the Strategic Issues. <a href="/Community/Collegeinfo/ie/aqip/Documents/2013SystemsPortfolio/2013_SP_Kankakee_CC.pdf">KCC submitted its last one in 2013</a>. This is an opportunity for an institution to get expert, objective, third-party feedback on its strengths and opportunities for improvement. In turn, institutions gain insight in determining the next targets for advancing quality through Action Projects and other plans. The analysis to be reviewed was given to KCC as part of its last Systems Appraisal. It ensures KCC understood the issues raised and confirms the strategy adopted by the college to follow-up on the advice in the Systems Appraisal.<br /></span><br /><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/feedback1.gif" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />Please send any comments/feedback on what you find most interesting or most influential to <a href="mailto:pdevol@kcc.edu">Dr. Purva DeVol</a>, director of institutional research. Those submitting feedback will be placed in a monthly drawing to win a gift certificate to Hammes Cafe which can be used for a Starbucks coffee or other drink. </p>
