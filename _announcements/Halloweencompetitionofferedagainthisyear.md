<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassEB9C6B5B6BAD4CAB923AFC63D58465B6"><p>​The KCC Halloween Competition is just around the corner! </p>
<p>The contest will be on Halloween, Friday, Oct. 31. For seven years, areas of the college have competed against each other for the best Halloween costumes and office theme.</p>
<p>&quot;The entire campus has been invited to participate for several years now and there has been some stiff competition in the past,” said Alison Nakaerts, one of the competition organizers. &quot;Everyone really stepped up their game last year. We look forward to all the new competition and hope you will join us! So gather your co-workers and get working on your theme for this year.&quot; </p>
<p>Each area's theme must be kept under wraps to keep the competition from borrowing ideas. As an incentive, the winning department will keep the “Fabulous” Traveling Tacky Trophy (shown at right) and will be able to show it off until the 2015 competition.</p>
<p>There also will be a Traveling Tacky Trophy for best costume. </p>
<p>If your department or staff in your area would like to get into the spirit of the day, please let Alison know at <a href="mailto:anakaerts@kcc.edu">anakaerts@kcc.edu</a> or 815-802-8654 by Friday, Oct. 24.</p>
