<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassB25D800A080A4E029D0F0781E154266E"><p>​New photos are being selected for the Hammes Café Photo Show. Students, faculty and staff are encouraged to submit their works for consideration. All works must be original photographs taken by the artist. Submissions are due by May 1 and can be emailed to Paul Carlson at pcarlson@kcc.edu. Photos must be .bmp or .jpg formats with a resolution of 300 dpi and be at least 12 inches by 18 inches in size. <br /><br />Photographs are selected by a small group of KCC faculty and administrators. Photos may be subject to editing to produce an enlarged image. Most photos will be reproduced at a minimum size of 20 inches by 30 inches. Any work accepted will be displayed for a minimum of one month, and will indicate the artist and title. </p>
<p>Artists will not be compensated for the use of the photographs in the display; however they will receive credit for the work and be allowed to retain the enlarged work when the exhibit has ended. Questions can be directed to Paul Carlson at ext. 8858 or pcarlson@kcc.eu or John Bordeau at ext. 8863 or jbordeau@kcc.edu<br /></p></div></div>
