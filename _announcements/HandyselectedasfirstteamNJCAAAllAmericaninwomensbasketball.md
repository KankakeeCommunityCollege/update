<div>
<div>KCC sophomore Sarafina Handy has been selected as a member of the first team NJCAA All-American women’s basketball team for the 2013-14 season.</div>
<div><br />The 5-foot-9 shooting guard started all 35 games for the Cavaliers. Following the season, the Handy made the top 10 nationally in four scoring categories: fifth in total points (664), eighth in three point goals (77), seventh in free throws made (159) and fourth in free throw percentage (83.7). </div>
<div><br />Handy, of Homewood, played two seasons for the Lady Cavaliers, and her career statistics include scoring 18.8 points per game, pulling down 4.3 rebounds a game, and shooting 86 percent from the free throw line. From the field, she shot 44 percent overall in two seasons, and also scored on 42 percent of her three-point attempts.</div>
<div><br />Another honor for Handy following the 2013-14 season was being amed First Team All-Region 4, garnering more votes than any other player. In addition, she was named Most Valuable Player following the Region 4 Division II tournament, which the Cavaliers won. </div>
<div><br />It was KCC’s 19th region championship in the last 25 years. By winning the region, the team gained a bid to the national tournament. The Lady Cavaliers basketball team has made more national tournament appearances than any other community college in the country. </div>
<div><br />“It’s a great honor to be named first team All-American,” Handy said. “But it is an honor that I received because of the help and hard work of my teammates.”</div>
<div><br />Handy contributed to a final record of 28 wins, 8 losses for the team, which ended the season ranked 10th in the nation. The team also finished as no. 1 in Region 4 and had a perfect record of 11 wins without a loss against region opponents. </div>
<div><br />In all, KCC has had 23 All-Americans from its women’s basketball program. Of them, eight were named to the academic team and 15 were named for athletic achievement.</div>
<div><br />“Sarafina has been through so much over the last three years with torn ACLs, and she continues to push herself on the floor and in the classroom,” said KCC Head Coach Donnie Denson. “She will be successful in life because she has a drive and purpose within her mentality to succeed.”</div>
<div><br />Due to injury, she was not able to play basketball during her senior year of high school at Marian Catholic High School. She also was hurt for all but 20 games during her freshman season for KCC. In May, Handy will graduate from KCC. She will transfer to Missouri Western State University in St. Joseph, Mo., on a full basketball scholarship.<br /></div>
