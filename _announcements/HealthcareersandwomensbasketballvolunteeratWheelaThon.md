<div>Options Center for Independent Living held two annual Wheel-a-Thon/Walk-a-Thons earlier this month. </div>
<div><br />KCC’s Health Careers’ team, comprised of students, faculty, and friends, was the top corporate fundraising team at the Kankakee event, held Sept. 14. They raised $825, all of which stays in Kankakee County. </div>
<div><br />“Additionally, with their hands in motions, the Health Careers ‘Helping Hands’ team brought home third place for their wheelchair decorating theme,” said Jessica Corbus, team organizer. “Way to go HCCE (Health Careers Team) for lending a hand to help the community!”</div>
<div><br />The KCC women’s basketball team did double duty by participating in both Options Wheel-a-Thons.</div>
<div><br />They were at the Iroquois County event on Saturday, Sept. 7 and the Kankakee County event. </div>
<div><br />Team members volunteered by assisting with event set-up, course preparation and event clean up. </div>
<div><br />&quot;The girls really did a nice job of representing the college and community,&quot; said Donnie Denson, head women’s basketball coach.<br /></div>
<div>Options Center for Independent Living’s mission is to increase opportunities for people with disabilities to live active, independent lives and participate in our community. The Iroquois County event was at Lakeview Park in Watseka. The Kankakee County event was at Perry Farm in Bourbonnais. </div>
<div><br />The Wheel-a-Thons raised more than $13,000.</div>
