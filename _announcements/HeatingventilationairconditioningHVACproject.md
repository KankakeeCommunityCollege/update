<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassDBFF2BE38F6648259CC32164C0F39B8F><div><font size=2>From Rich Soderquist, director of facilities and campus safety<br> <br>Following is information about the 2011 heating, ventilation, air-conditioning (HVAC) project<br> <br><font color="#0000ff">Scope<br></font>    The project consists of replacing three air handling units on the roof which supply heated/cooled air to the L Building between the first floor reception desk (west end of the project) to the east elevator, stairway and Physical Plant area (east end of the project). Please see the attached maps of the first floor, second floor and third floor which highlight the project areas.<br> <br><font color="#0000ff">Affected areas<br></font>    First floor: College Center, faculty dining area, Auditorium, Cavalier Room, student life office, public safety office, and Physical Plant Department. <br>    Second floor: Administrative Hallway, President's Office, Board Room, Room L244 to Room L232, the Business Office, Accounting Office, Human Resource Office, Admissions and Registration, Office of Financial Aid, and Room L201. <br>    Third floor: All classrooms and staff areas from Room L347 and Room L344 east to Room L305 and the east women's rest room. <br>(subhead)<br> <br><font color="#0000ff">Areas not affected, but near the affected areas<br></font>    Food Services Incorporated kitchen <br>    Cafeteria<br>    Bookstore<br>    Iroquois Room and Room D151<br>    LRC Reception desk<br>    Student services from Room D221 to Room D239<br>    Room D211 to Room D218<br>    Room L20A to Room L20F<br>    Room L30A to Room L30G<br>    Room D326 to Room D330<br> <br><font color="#0000ff">Project schedule<br></font>    May 2-6: Installation of valves and manifolds to the chilled water piping system. Effect: No air-conditioning functioning anywhere of the campus.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    May 9-13: The no. 2 chiller units will be started and air-conditioning will be functional for areas not affected by the project.</div>
<div><br>    May 15 - June 17: Demolition of the existing air handling units begins. Most of the work will occur on the roof and in the roof mechanical penthouses. Effect: Air-conditioning will not be available in the affected areas. Any concerns or questions, please contact Brian Yeoman at 815-802-8176 or Rob Kenney at 815-802-8194.</div>
<div><br>    June 20 - July 8: Installation of the new air handling units. Most of the work will occur on the roof and in the roof penthouses. Some isolated work will occur while relocating existing thermostats in occupied areas. Effect: Air conditioning will not be available in the affected areas.</div>
<div><br>    July 11-15: Computer control work and initial start up of the units. Effect: Partial air will flow through the air conditioning system to the affected areas. Temperatures will fluctuate.</div>
<div><br>    July 18-29: Test and balance of the air handlers and equipment in the duct work. Adjustments will be made to the vent system. Effect: Partial air flow through the air-conditioning system to the affected areas. Temperatures will fluctuate.</div>
<div><br>    Aug. 1: The new system will be functional. Effect: The affected areas will have full air-conditioning.<br> <br><font color="#0000ff">Implications<br></font>    All areas under construction have been tested for asbestos-containing material. None was found. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Therefore, there will be no remediation or localized containment needed. All of the work will be completed &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; except for relocation of thermostats to meet current code. Disruption to occupied areas should be minimal. The majority of lifting of heavy material and demolition material will take place on Fridays when the campus is closed. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>During demolition of duct work and the removal of sheet metal, odors may occur in some areas. These are not harmful, only unpleasant. Fans will be used to keep the air moving in the affected areas, and to circulate as much outside air as possible. As much of the sheet metal cutting as possible will take place in the early morning before full occupancy.<br> <br><font color="#0000ff">Mitigation of challenging environmental conditions<br></font>    All credit classes have been relocated to other areas of the college. No classes will be held in the affected areas for the duration of the project. All but a few adult education classes have been relocated. Room L305 will be used periodically for five morning classes from June 3 to July 29 and Room L306 will be used on Tuesday and Wednesday mornings from May24 to July 27 between 10 a.m. and noon for general adult education classes. During that time, fans and a portable air conditioning unit will be used to cool the rooms when necessary.</div>
<div><br>Air-conditioning in the operational areas of the college will be lowered by 3 degrees and then pulled from common areas of the college to the affected locations.</div>
<div><br>    Four large fans will be set up in the College Center to pull tempered air in from other areas and circulate it within the space.</div>
<div><br>    Two portable air-conditioners will be in the Business Office and fans will be used to circulate tempered air.</div>
<div><br>    Two portable air-conditioning units will be in the Admissions and Registration area and fans will be used to circulate tempered air.</div>
<div><br>    One portable air conditioner will be in the Office of Financial Aid area, and fans will be used to move tempered air.</div>
<div><br>    One portable air conditioning unit will be in Administrative Hallway.</div>
<div><br>    One portable air conditioning unit will be available as-needed for third floor office areas. </div>
<div><br>    Fans will be used to pull air from the adjacent hallways where the air is conditioned on all three floors.</div>
<div><br>    Room-size fans will be made available to individual office areas as needed.</div>
<div><br>    Should faculty need to relocate from an office in the affected area, please see the division administrative assistant for help coordinating the relocation. Any other staff member who feels a need to relocate should contact his/her supervisor. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Supervisors who are unable to identify an available location, can contact Rich Soderquist at 815-802-8173 or the Business Office.</div>
<div><br>    Physical Plant staff will do everything possible to help make everyone as comfortable as possible. </font></div>
