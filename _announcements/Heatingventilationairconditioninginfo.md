<div><br>The three new air handling units are being delivered to the college on Monday, June 6. </div>
<div><br>Throughout the day, the units will be lifted to the east and west penthouses on the L Building roof. Beginning at 6 a.m. June 6, the loading dock area, the east campus entrance by the bookstore, and the east entrance by the Physical Plant Department will be blocked off. They will remain closed until June 7.</div>
<div><br>“If at all possible, please remain clear of the area for safety purposes,” said Rich Soderquist, director of facilities and campus security. “Thank you for your patience.”</div>
<div><br>Sidewalks, paths and roadways in the area will be intermittently closed during lifting. </div>
<div><br>The employee parking lot will be open, but truck traffic will be in the area during unloading. </div>
<div><br>A crane will be in the loading dock roadway, and the three air handling units will be lifted from semi trailer trucks parked in the east truck turn lane north of the employee lot. </div>
<div><br>If severe weather disrupts the schedule, the lifting will take place as soon as possible after Monday with the same restrictions in place. </div>
<div><br>If they occur, schedule changes will be listed here, in Daily Update. <br></div></div></div>
