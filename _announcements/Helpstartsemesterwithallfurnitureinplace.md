<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass583B7E49CCB143BCBF3E028B1DD65EB1"><p>​The college conducted an inventory of all common area furniture to make sure we maximize seating in study, group chat, and common areas before the fall semester begins. </p>
<p>There are places where chairs/seats are missing:</p>
<ul><li>Hallways of the Workforce Development Center -- Black cloth seats with light wood backs</li>
<li>Arts and Sciences Building -- Black cloth seats with light wood backs</li>
<li>College Center -- Black vinyl and steel </li>
<li>Cavalier Room -- Red cloth chairs</li></ul>
<p>Anyone who knows where these chairs might be is asked to please notify Physical Plant Department by phone at 815-802-8170, in person or by <a href="mailto:mpolka">email</a>.</p>
<p>The hope is that all chairs can be back in place for student use when the fall semester begins. Thank you!</p></div></div>
