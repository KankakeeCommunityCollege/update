<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass8C6A6F479BDD459BA4151C3195EAA583"><p>​KCC employees and students are invited to take part in a fundraiser that ends with pie throwing.</p>
<p>Here's how it works: the Student Advisory Council collect change in containers in the College Center. The containers will have KCC professors' names on them. Every filled container will equal a pie in the face of that professor. Multiple pies can be thrown at the same professor if his/her container is filled more than once.</p>
<p>Coins will be collected Nov. 3 to 21. Pies will be thrown Monday, Nov. 24 and Tuesday, Nov. 25 at 12:15 p.m. in the College Center.</p>
<p>Proceeds will be used to fund a de-stressing event during finals week. Faculty and staff also are asked to share this opportunity with students.</p>
