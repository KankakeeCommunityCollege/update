<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass21ABA70C05884D998BF11CEDA7988242"><p>​Students from local students are displaying their original artwork during the 25th annual Kankakee Community College High School Juried Art Exhibition.</p>
<p>The show is March 2 to 25 in the lower level art gallery in the <a href="/library">Harold and Jean Miner Memorial Library</a> at KCC. </p>
<p>A reception, awards presentation and juror’s critique will be held on the final evening of the exhibit, Wednesday, March 25, from 6-8 p.m. Awards in categories such as Painting, Color Drawing/Design, Photography/electronic imaging and 3-D Design will be revealed at 7:15 p.m. Jurors are the KCC art faculty. </p>
<p>“Visitors to the exhibit will easily sense some of the pride, enthusiasm, humor, reverence and even pain that the students experience in their lives,” said Chelise Slowik, a KCC art professor. “Overall, it is a beautiful display of our future local artists. It shows off the talent of not only these amazing high school students, but that of their gifted teachers as well.”</p>
<p>Applications for the $800 High School Art Exhibit Scholarship will be available for all participants in the show. The scholarship can be used for tuition, books and fees for any classes at KCC.</p>
<p>The exhibit is sponsored by KCC's Visual Arts Department.</p>
<p>The picture shown is of <em>One With Nature</em>, by Briana Barth, a student at<br />Manteno High School.<br /><br /></p>
