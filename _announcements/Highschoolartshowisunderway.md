<div>Students from area high schools will display their original artwork during the 24th annual KCC High School Juried Art Exhibition, which begins this week.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It can be viewed March 3 to 26 in the lower level art gallery in the Miner Memorial Library. A closing reception and awards presentation, including jurors' critiques, will be Wednesday, March 26 from 6-8 p.m. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Participants chosen for awards in categories such as Painting, Color Drawing/Design, Photography/electronic imaging and 3-D Design will be revealed at 7:15 p.m. with the presentation of awards by the jurors, KCC art faculty. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Applications for the High School Art Exhibit Scholarship will be available for all participants in the show. The scholarship can be used for tuition, books and fees for any classes at KCC.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Visitors to the exhibit will easily sense some of the pride, enthusiasm, humor, reverence and even pain that the students experience in their lives,” said Chelise Slowik, art professor. “Overall, it is a beautiful display of our future local artists. It shows off the talent of not only these amazing high school students, but that of their gifted teachers as well. It is quite an exciting event!”<br /></div>
<div>Around 12 area high schools are expected to participate in the exhibit, sponsored by KCC's Visual Arts Department.<br /></div>
<div>Gallery hours are 7:45 a.m. - 8 p.m. Monday through Thursday; 7:45 a.m. - 4 p.m. Fridays; and 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. Saturdays. From March 10 to 13, the gallery will close at 5 p.m.</div>
