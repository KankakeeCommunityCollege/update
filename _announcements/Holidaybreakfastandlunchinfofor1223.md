<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassB59AB04950434FCB94C4F865730DA9F5"><p style="color:#000000">Happy Holiday Greetings Everyone!</p>
<p>As we conclude the fall semester, I would like to thank each and every one of you for all of your contributions that have been made this year. </p>
<p>As an expression of gratitude, there will be a holiday breakfast buffet for all employees on Tuesday, Dec 23, from 8:30-9:30 a.m. in the College Center catered by Arena Food Service. The buffet will be set up in front of the cafeteria.</p>
<p>Additionally, pizza, salad and beverages will be served at noon in the Cavalier Room. If you want to showcase your baking abilities, feel free to bring a dessert to share at the pizza party. Please bring your dessert to share to the Cavalier Room by 11 a.m.  </p>
<p>Both the College Center and the Cavalier Room are reserved so you can sit in either one of the two areas.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for your commitment and dedication to our students and KCC. On behalf of the Board of Trustees and myself, we wish you and your family a safe and happy Holiday season!<br /><br />Warm Regards,<br />Dr. A<br /></p></div></div>
