<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassD50DCAF6479C43D387CBD2E2D788A947"><p>​​At age 15, Liz Murray lived on the streets in the Bronx. Today, she is a bestselling author and Harvard University graduate. </p>
<p>Murray will share the inspirational story of how she turned her life around at an event Wednesday, Nov. 5 at 7:30 p.m. at the Hilton Garden Inn, 455 Riverstone Pkwy. in Kankakee. The event is hosted by the KCC Foundation Women’s Giving Circle “Educate, Empower, Endeavor” program and sponsored by PNC Foundation’s Financial Literacy Grant. Tickets are $15 per person, and include dessert. For reservations, phone Imani Cobb of the KCC Foundation at 815-802-8252. Seating begins at 7:15 p.m.</p>
<p>Murray’s memoir, “Breaking Night” (Hyperion, 2010), is a New York Times bestseller. Her story also was the inspiration for the 2003 Lifetime Original Movie, “Homeless to Harvard.” </p>
<p>“Liz’s story is inspiring and a reminder of why it is so important to help students locally who are struggling and face hardship,” said Kelly Myers, executive director of the KCC Foundation.</p>
<p>“Murray’s life is a triumph over adversity and a stunning example of the importance of dreaming big,” said the Washington Speakers Bureau. “Murray’s life as the child of cocaine-addicted parents in the Bronx was bitterly grim. There was never food in the house, everything was filthy, drugs were everywhere and the welfare checks were spent before they arrived. By age 15, Murray’s mom had died and she was homeless—living on the streets, riding the subway all night and eating from dumpsters.”</p>
<p>Murray always imagined her life could be much better than it was. “I started to grasp the value of the lessons learned while living on the streets,” she said. “I knew, after overcoming those daily obstacles that next to nothing could hold me down.” Murray finished high school in just two years while camping out in New York City parks and subway stations. She was awarded a scholarship by the New York Times, which enabled her to enroll in college. Murray received a bachelor’s degree in psychology from Harvard University in June 2009. She is now pursuing a master’s degree, also at Harvard.</p>
<p>Murray was a recipient of Oprah Winfrey’s first ever “Chutzpah Award,” recognizing women whose “audacity, nerve, boldness, conviction—has taken them to the most amazing places.”</p>
