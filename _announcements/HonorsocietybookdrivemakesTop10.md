<div><font size=2>    KCC's Phi Theta Kappa chapter was recently recognized by Better World Books for achievement in its Winner's Circle as one of the top 10 book drives in the nation for Fall 2010.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    The chapter participated at the &quot;diamond&quot; level of activity for the book drive.</div>
<div><br>    &quot;The diamond level requires chapter members to accomplish a higher number of participation requirements,&quot; said Susan LaMore, one of KCC's chapter advisors. &quot;The top 10 list is based on the number of acceptable books that were sent from KCC.&quot;</div>
<div><br>    More than 2,100 colleges and universities in North America have worked with Better World Books to make donations. The books generate funds for literacy initiatives across the globe, but also diverted more than 15,000 tons of books away from landfills. </div>
<div><br>    KCC's Phi Theta Kappa chapter holds a campus-wide book drive at the end of each semester during textbook buy-back days. The Learning Resource Center has also added books to the drive as they are removed from the library shelves. The project also serves as a fundraiser for the Phi Theta Kappa chapter.</div>
