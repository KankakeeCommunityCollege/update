<div><br />For several years, the Learning Resource Center has housed a special collection devoted to sustainability materials. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This collection is located on the main level near the entrance of the LRC and is part of the Sustainability Center. This collection provides faculty, staff and the community at-large with resources needed to promote sustainable activities. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Topics such as renewable energy, climate change and sustainable careers are among some of the subjects in this collection. In addition, there are a series of discussion guides, published by the Northwest Earth Institute which can be used as a way for generating discussion and/or ideas for classroom discussion.</div>
<div><br />Materials in the sustainability collection can be found in the KCC Online Catalog. </div>
