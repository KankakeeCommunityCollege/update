<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass6C045C7E15F84F6BB93320D8868C5CAC"><p>Throughout fall semester, participating faculty will meet regularly to collaborate and share the goal of developing their own full courses in hybrid format. The Teaching and Learning Center will provide support and guidance with instructional design concepts and technical skill development important for this modality. There will be numerous resources provided, discussions, and sharing with and among the group as we develop hybrid courses aligned with best-known practices.<br /><br />An initial kickoff meeting has been scheduled for Thursday, Sept. 7 at 2 p.m. in Room D327. At this first event, we will establish goals and objectives for the group and determine subsequent meeting dates and frequency. Please note that prior completion, or concurrent enrollment, in the Canvas Challenge is a requirement.</p>
