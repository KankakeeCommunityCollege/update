<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass98A096F0DA9D44FABD640CCF09F1FC5C"><p>​<span style="color:#00558d">Submitted by Michael O’Connor, director of information technology services</span></p>
<p><span style="color:#00558d"></span>Approximately one year ago, the Information Technology Services Department instituted an automated calling solution for our main help desk number of ext. 8900 as a process improvement. It was our expectation that this approach would provide our customers with a new level of customer self-service designed to keep them updated on system outages as well as answer frequently asked questions such as “What is my User ID?,” “How do I change my password?” etc.</p>
<p>Recently, we reviewed the data associated with this initiative and discovered that the changes we expected to see did not materialize. As such we will  return to having the main help desk number, ext. 8900, answered by a “live” person effective immediately.</p>
<p>This change back to a live voice is intended to address concerns some of our customers had regarding the use of an auto attendant, but more importantly to re-establish ext. 8900 as the single point of contact for all originating information technology related telephone requests.</p>
<p>In order for us to effectively log and track all requests for IT support, the initial contact needs to be made through the ITS Help Desk at ext. 8900, <a href="mailto:helpdesk@kcc.edu">helpdesk@kcc.edu</a>, or face-to-face in Room L364. No originating requests for IT support should be made directly to an ITS staff member, i.e. direct call or direct email. This will ensure that we provide you with the most effective and timely service possible regarding your request.</p>
<p>As always, if you have any questions or concerns regarding this change, please feel free to contact me directly.</p></div></div>
