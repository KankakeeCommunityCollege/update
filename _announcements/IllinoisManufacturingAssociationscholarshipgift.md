KCC is one of six institutions to receive the scholarship this summer.<br /><br />In 2013, KCC renovated an empty warehouse to create a Manufacturing and Industrial Technology Center which offers courses in welding, fabrication, millwright and machine tool. It has four classrooms, reception and office spaces, and open instructional areas. <br /><br />“The Manufacturing and Industrial Technology Center is an excellent example of how KCC turns community needs into educational opportunities,” said Avendano. “Several of our local manufacturers had vacancies for welders, millwrights and fabricators and they turned to the college to help fill the positions. The KCC degree and certificate programs offered at the MITC are perfect fits. <br /><br />“We are grateful to the IMA for their generous gift. Their scholarships will give even more students the opportunity to prepare for good-paying jobs.”<br /><br />“We know that students want to learn skills quickly and move into the workforce,” said Paul Carlson, associate dean of the Business/Technology Division at KCC. “That’s why we developed a series of certificates that can build on each other and lead to an associate degree. Students can complete certificates, move into the workplace and continue to take additional courses around their work schedules.”<br /><br />Within six weeks of taking manufacturing classes at KCC, Gage Kozial earned a total of five, third party industry Manufacturing Skill Standards Council (MSSC) certifications. With his new education on his résumé, he was able to obtain a job as a machine operator with Pactiv, one of the world’s largest manufacturers and distributors of food packaging and foodservice products. He continued taking courses with an eye on qualifying for a union operator position.<br /><br />“Within seven months of starting my KCC education, I landed my dream job,” said Kozial. “I can’t wait to see how far my KCC education will take me.”<br /><br />“The students at Kankakee Community College have the potential to ensure our state will continue to build a strong pipeline for the workforce and fill the skills gap that is facing our industry,” said Greg Baise, president and CEO, Illinois Manufacturers’ Association. “We hope to continue broadening participation and working with these institutions to increase success across the board for students pursuing opportunities in the manufacturing sector.”<br /><br />Among the objectives of the foundation is a provision to provide scholarship opportunities for deserving students following a pathway of study to a manufacturing career. Community colleges receiving funding must demonstrate they have met standards of education and training in the manufacturing and technology sector.</p>
