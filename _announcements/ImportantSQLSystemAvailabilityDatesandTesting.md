<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass933CCCD9352246C9BD5891D9864A9897"><p>​Submitted by Michael O’Connor, director of Information Technology Services<br /><br />This is just a reminder that KCC’s final SQL data migration date is rapidly approaching. Datatel will be unavailable from 5 p.m. Friday, Dec. 19 until 8 a.m. Monday, Dec. 22. During the migration, Information Technology Services staff, in conjunction with Marketing Department staff, will provide updates via email about the migration progress, including when the system is back online.<br /><br />The only two systems affected by this downtime are Datatel and KCConnect. Online registration, online payments, grades, etc., will not be available during the downtime.<br /><br />All other systems/services including email, network file access, and the KCC Web site, will be unaffected.<br /><br />KCC staff will start testing the new production SQL environment Monday, Dec. 22 at 8 a.m. Where in the past we were using “test” data in our “test” environments, this phase will have us actually testing with “live” data within our new production SQL environment. This “real world” testing is crucial as it will ensure that our student information system will be ready when we return from winter break on Jan. 5.<br /><br />It is also important to note that all KCC systems and services will be fully operational on Monday, Dec. 22.<br /><br />If there are any questions or concerns around the final SQL data migration or SQL testing, please feel free to contact me directly at 815-802-8908.<br /><br /></p></div></div>
