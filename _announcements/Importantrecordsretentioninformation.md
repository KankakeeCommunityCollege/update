<div> </div>
<div>KCC is in the process of rewriting its records retention application with the state of Illinois.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Records Retention Task Group is responsible for developing the policy regarding maintenance of the college’s records. This policy is enacted because the Illinois State Records Act mandates that records may not be disposed of until approved by the Records Management Section of the State Archives. A complete Records Retention Manual as it relates to KCC is maintained by the Business Office. This manual contains retention schedules based upon the State Records Act. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><font color="#000080"><strong>Do not delete KCC business-related emails</strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div>One important aspect of records retention is that emails related to KCC business are a record and therefore should not be deleted. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For further information on folder management to archive--but not delete--email, contact Information Technology Services help desk. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Records Retention Task Group also has identified a person in each area of the college to be responsible for records retention. In the next couple of months, this person will be collecting information from each employee on the quantity of emails he/she has.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Information meetings also are being planned to further share details of the State Records Act and the college’s policy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To learn more about the records retention policy, or to become more involved, please let a member of the task group know. They are: Juli Gereg, Beth Nunley, Michael O’Connor, Jeni Chaffer and Rose Mitchell. <br /></div>
