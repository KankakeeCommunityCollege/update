<ul><li>Each cohort will be limited to 20 students.</li>

<li>Classes will be delivered in both blended and online formats.</li>
<li>A dedicated faculty mentor will assist students as they progress throughout the program.</li>
<li>Offered at two locations: Riverfront Campus and Miner South Extension Center.</li>
