<div> </div>
<div>It is time for annual performance appraisals of administrators and supportive staff. The process includes reflection on your accomplishments, how you met/exceeded last year's goals, and what specific goals/objectives await you in the coming fiscal year. <br /></div>
<div>The deadline for submitting the forms to Human Resources for non-supervisory staff is April 12. The deadline to submit supervisor evaluations into Human Resources is May 10. Please consult your immediate supervisor for his/her deadline which will allow time for all levels of supervision to review evaluations before the Human Resources deadline dates. Electronic forms are available at O:\Share\KCC\Human Resources\HR Forms\Evaluation Forms.  <br /></div>
<div>As part of this process, if the position description is not accurate, the supervisor should make proposed revisions and submit to Human Resources with the evaluation. A &quot;Specific responsibilities&quot; section should be included! <br /> <br />The process will be as follows: </div>
<div><br />1. The staff member completes a self-evaluation.<br /></div>
<div>2. After the self-evaluation is complete and submitted as a Word document to the employee's immediate supervisor, a meeting is scheduled with the employee's immediate supervisor to discuss performance, to review the completed tasks, to establish new goals for the next year through March 2014, and to complete the final evaluation. Note: Input/support from department directors should be solicited prior to this meeting.</div>
<div><br />3. Upon completion, the evaluation is signed by the employee, the immediate supervisor, and the appropriate department director. Copies should be given to the employee and his/her immediate supervisor. The electronic file should be saved by the supervisor to use during next year's evaluation process. </div>
<div><br />4. A final hard copy (paper) is sent to Human Resources to be used to support any salary increase approved by the board of trustees to be effective July 1, 2013. <br /></div>
<div>Please contact me if you have any questions regarding this process at 815-802-8128. </div>
