<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass98EDAC436A2D424090F1DDF001CF4918">
<div>Students can now record their campus and community involvement and leadership experiences through KCC’s Co-Curricular Transcript service.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A co-curricular transcript supplements a student’s academic transcript. Course grades, grade point average, degrees earned, etc. are not included on the co-curricular transcript.  </div>
<div>Students and alumni can send official copies of their co-curricular transcripts to other colleges, universities and employers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Students can request activity supervisors to validate their documented activities, and provide comments on the student. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you oversee a program or event on-campus or in the community that will have student attendees and/or student volunteers; you may receive email requests from students to have their participation validated. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Emails will be from “Folio180” from the address <a href="mailto:support@data180.com">support@data180.com</a>. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The student’s name will be given and you will be asked to click on a link to verify their participation. You will also be given the opportunity to provide comments about the student; your comments will be included on their co-curricular transcript. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>More information is on KCC’s <a href="/students/studentlife/Pages/cocurricular.aspx">co-curricular transcript service page</a>.</div>
