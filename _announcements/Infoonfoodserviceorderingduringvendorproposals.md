<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE213F1D0711649AA8B319C89041D3369">
<div>
<div>KCC is seeking proposals for food service operations after July 31, 2014, and a decision will be made by July 15. <br /> <br />Anyone with a food order for events after July 31 is advised to still book the food with Food Service Incorporated. FSI has submitted a proposal to continue as the college's food operator. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rob Stelmaszewski, director of dining services, said that during the proposal process, FSI will continue to work with KCC staff on future catered events. He said in the event another provider is selected, FSI will share the schedule events with KCC and the new vendor.<br /> <br />Note: FSI will not quote prices of catering events planned after July 31. After a vendor is selected, then prices will become available.</div>
