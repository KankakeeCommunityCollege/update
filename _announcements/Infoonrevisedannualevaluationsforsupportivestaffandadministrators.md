<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassFDC12B6670D54CA9BDCF0AAA96320B45><div><font size=2>From: David Cagle, director of Human Resources<br> <br>    It is time for annual performance appraisals of administrators and supportive staff.  </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    The process includes reflection on your accomplishments, how you met/exceeded last year's goals, and what specific goals/objectives await you in the coming fiscal year. </div>
<div><br>    For 2011, the forms have been revised. The revision was a collaborative effort among members of the Employee Morale Committee and its sub-committees. Due to the revisions, the deadlines for submitting the forms to Human Resources is two weeks later: non-supervisory staff evaluation are due April 15 and supervisory evaluations are due May 13. </div>
<div><br>    Please consult your immediate supervisor for his/her deadline which will allow time for all levels of supervision to review evaluations before the Human Resources deadline dates.</div>
<div><br>    Here is a summary of changes to the evaluation forms: </div>
<div><br>    1. The new format includes the mission statement, six strategic goals, and five core values.</div>
<div><br>    2. Two categories of forms are available, supervisory and non-supervisory. The decision on which form to use is made by each department supervisor/director.</div>
<div><br>    3. The same forms are being used by part-time staff.</div>
<div><br>    4. Both supervisors and non-supervisors evaluation forms include nine performance factors in addition to the narrative sections. Note: The old supportive staff evaluation forms had 41 performance factors.</div>
<div><br>    5. &quot;Self&quot; line and a &quot;Supervisor&quot; lines on the form make it easily identifiable where there is agreement and disagreement in performance.</div>
<div><br>    6. There are now four rating levels. </div>
<div><br>    7. &quot;Needs improvement&quot; and &quot;Unsatisfactory performance&quot; ratings require the supervisor to comment on the reasons for the rating. For all other ratings, employee and/or supervisor comments are optional.</div>
<div><br>    8. &quot;Employee action plan&quot; section defines goals &amp; objectives, and professional growth and development needs. One employee goal must be aligned with a college strategic goal or core value. </div>
<div><br>    9.If the position description is not accurate, the supervisor should make proposed revisions and submit to Human Resources with the evaluation. A &quot;Specific responsibilities&quot; section should be included! <br> <br>The process will be as follows: </div>
<div><br>    1. The staff member completes a self-evaluation. Non-Supervisory Personnel Evaluation Form -- O:Share\KCC\Human Resources\Evaluation Forms\Non Supervisory; Supervisory Personnel Evaluation Form -- O:Share\KCC\Human Resources\Supervisory. </div>
<div><br>    2. After the self-evaluation is complete and submitted as a Word document to the employee's immediate supervisor, a meeting is scheduled with the employee's immediate supervisor to discuss performance, to review the completed tasks, to establish new goals for the next year through March 2012, and to complete the final evaluation. Note: Input/support from department directors should be solicited prior to this meeting.</div>
<div><br>    3. Upon completion, the evaluation is signed by the employee, the immediate supervisor, and the appropriate department director. Copies should be given to the employee and his/her immediate supervisor. The electronic file should be saved by the supervisor to use during next year's evaluation process. </div>
<div><br>    4. A final hard copy (paper) is sent to Human Resources to be used to support any salary increase approved by the board of trustees to be effective July 1, 2011. </div>
<div><br>    Please contact me if you have any questions regarding the new forms at 815-802-8128.</font>   <br> </div></div></div>
