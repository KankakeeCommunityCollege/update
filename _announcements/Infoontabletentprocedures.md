<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass5D9DF141243146E3A123A5306B250F6C><div><font size=2>    The offices of student life and marketing have collaborated to create a procedure to keep the College Center looking attractive by having a limit of one table tent on display at any given time. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    To have a table tent displayed, work with the same contact from marketing or student life as in the past. Student and club requests are made through Lindsey Fritz, coordinator of student life &amp; development. All other requests are made through the appropriate marketing representative: Kari Sargeant, Nancy Schunke or Ellen Skelly.</div>
<div><br>    Space on tables can be reserved on a first-come first-served basis.</div>
<div><br>    When the request is made, it will be reserved on a calendar, with a maximum of seven days on display for each.</div>
<div><br>    The procedure applies to all table tents, including those not printed by KCC's media department. <br></div></font></div></div>
