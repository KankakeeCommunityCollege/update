<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass769065FD64574C688EB0317A7B9592FD"><div>The General Educational Development Test (GED) will become computer-based in January 2014.<br /> <br />If students have already passed some of the GED tests, but have not completed the whole test, they are advised to complete it by December of 2013.<br /> <br />The current GED and the new test cannot be combined. In other words, students who don't complete the test by the end of 2013 will have to start from scratch and re-take the entire test. <br /> <br />As of Nov. 16, first-time testers must wait for the 2014 test. Until the end of this year, students who have already taken part of the GED can finish it on the computer or with paper/pencil. The site <br /><a href="http://www.gedcomputer.com/">http://www.gedcomputer.com/</a> has a list of testing sites, including KCC.</div>
