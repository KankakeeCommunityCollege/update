<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC4A458DAD7174510B39379993A5673BC"><div><font color="#000080">Submitted by Penny Berger, recorder for KCC's chapter of SUAA </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Imagine signing a contract to buy a new car with an auto dealership. You made all your payments faithfully and on time every month. After six years, you pay the final amount and the auto dealership tells you they changed their mind and will not let you have the car. The decision is final and you do not have a new car nor the thousands of dollars you paid the dealership according to the contract.</div>
<div><br />KCC staff and friends, this is what is happening to your retirement with SURS! We are lucky to have the KCC Chapter of the State Universities Annuitants Association (SUAA) fighting for our retirement! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Help by contributing to the legal fund. The contribution goal for KCC’s chapter is $5,000. However, only 10 percent of the 194 members have contributed to the legal fund for a total of $2,565.<br /></div>
<div>Linda Guinn, president of our local chapter, has advised that SUAA has hired excellent experienced attorneys who filed and won an injunction against Illinois State Bill 1 (SB1, which amended state employees' pension plans) until the constitutionality of the bill is ruled upon. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Help SUAA continue to fight for your retirement! </div>
<div><br />Please send a check to SUAA Legal Fund, c/o SUAA, 217 E. Monroe, Suite 100, Springfield, IL 62701 or <a href="http://www.suaa.org/SUAALegalFundDonationForm.php">click this link</a> and use your credit card. This is serious – you deserve to have your retirement!</div>
