<div>The KCC mailroom would like to notify employees of changes recently made by the U.S. Postal Service.</div>
<div><br />These changes pertain to “folded self-mailers,” which basically means the item is folded and not in an envelope.</div>
<div><br />-- Printing must be on 70 pound paper or heavier. Standard copier paper is no longer acceptable.<br />-- There is a minimum of two non-perforated tabs to keep the piece closed. Tape is not acceptable.<br />-- The final fold must be at the bottom of the mail piece.</div>
<div><br />According to the Postal Service, failure to follow requirements will result in the mailing not being accepted, or it may be charged at a higher “non-machine rate.”</div>
<div><br />All changes are effective immediately.</div>
<div><br />Anyone with questions regarding mailings is invited to contact Mary Polka at <a href="mailto:mpolka@kcc.edu">mpolka@kcc.edu</a> or 815-802-8174.</div>
