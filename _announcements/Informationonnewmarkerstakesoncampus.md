<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass4362D1AC5AB04F8992056648819A3D61"><div>
<div>Physical Plant Department has received questions regarding the new marker stakes and their purpose.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The marker stakes have been put in the ground in the Main Courtyard and some other locations around campus. They were put in place for the winter snow months, and are used as guides to protect our new and existing landscape from damage by machinery used to clear and remove snow.</div>
<div><br />Anyone with questions or comments regarding the markers is invited to contact <a href="mailto:mpolka@kcc.edu">Mary Polka</a>, specialist I for Physical Plant Department.</div>
