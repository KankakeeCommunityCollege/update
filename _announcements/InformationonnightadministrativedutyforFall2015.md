<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass00EC060B60884BE7AF6EA5352ECF9851"><p>​There will not be typical night administrative duty assignments for administrators during the Fall 2015 semester.</p>
<p>&quot;With the police force now in place, and after a study revealed that most calls for assistance were security related, a decision has been made to try a semester without assigned night administrators,&quot; said Vicki Gardner, vice president for finance and administration.</p>
<p>To ensure all goes smoothly, during the first two weeks there will be instructional and student services administrators on the Riverfront Campus until the last classes of the day begin.</p>
<p>Anyone who has questions regarding this decision is invited to contact Vicki or their supervisor.</p>
