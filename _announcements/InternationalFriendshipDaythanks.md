<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass0A72DA1617624AC0AB3DEA3AFA80FB67><div><font size=2>From: Elise Schultz, Cultural Diversity Committee <br> <br>    On March 23, the College Center and surrounding areas were filled with students and staff enjoying the International Friendship Day celebration.  </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    Participants had their &quot;KCC Passports&quot; stamped at each of the country and organizational displays to qualify for the raffle drawings and lunch discount. There were opportunities to see a film; view arts, crafts, traditional clothing; learn about campus organizations, and collect information aimed at helping members of the college community become more globally aware.</div>
<div><br>    Highlights of the day included a Latin dance lesson, morning and evening showings of the film Little Town of Bethlehem, and informative presentations. The latter included Rich Schultz on sustainability, and two students competing for a free course in the International Friendship Day Scholarship Contest. <br>    <br>Chef Auston and Food Services also received rave reviews for their international lunch special, served by staff and student volunteers in the lower level of the College Center. <br> <br>Many thanks!<br>    An event such as this is only possible through great teamwork.
