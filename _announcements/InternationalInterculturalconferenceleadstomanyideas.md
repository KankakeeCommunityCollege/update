<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass00463D5751CB4842B2D7469B42A44720">
<div>Several faculty members attended the Midwest Institute for International/Intercultural Education (MIIIE) conference on April 11 and 12 in Columbus, Ohio.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The purpose of the conference was to share ideas for bringing international ideas into curriculum and fostering educational partnerships within colleges on global concerns. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>“The presentations were of high-quality academic work and the presenters shared from their passion for learning,&quot; said Dr. Deisy Anderson, who attended this year’s conference. &quot;Generally, they were community college Midwesterners, similar to us, with access to applied knowledge more than status and money. As a result, we realized that we, too, can use our energy and interests to arrange opportunities for KCC students to engage in learning about culture and diversity which assists their career paths. We also expect that through study and travel opportunities students will innately discover courage toward independence and appreciation of their roots and culture.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Students need to engage in international and cultural awareness to learn different perspectives and ways of thinking,&quot; added Dana Washington. &quot;Although we are in an age of meta-corporations with global contacts, many people don’t know how to follow protocol or understand the cultural customs of communication with these international corporations, some of whom are in our own Kankakee-area community. Attending the MIIIE conference gave me creative suggestions to aid student-learning about the essential needs of diversity, and right now I feel like a firecracker—I am sizzling with ideas on ways to connect the needs and interests of our local fair trade businesses with KCC students.”</div>
<div><br />Penelope Stickney is co-chair of KCC's Cultural Diversity Committee and she has been invited to serve on the MIIIE board from 2014-16. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Deisy and Penelope (at left and in the center in the photo) are professors in the Humanities and Social Sciences Division. Dana (shown at right) is director of workforce services and an adjunct professor who teaches the computer literacy course.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyone with questions or who would like to participate in upcoming International/Intercultural Education opportunities is invited to contact Penelope. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Penelope also has shared that the summer 2014 will offer workshops in Michigan on topics of sustainability and global firms, labor and development. In Spring 2015, the MIIIE conference will be in Indianapolis.</div>
