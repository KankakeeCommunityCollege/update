<p>The Business Office is in the process of forming a taskforce to coordinate a college-wide inventory. We need volunteers from each department to help with this project. Your commitment as a taskforce member is this: monthly planning meetings beginning in July, and helping with coordinating the actual inventory in your area sometime between September and November.  </p>
<p>We look forward to adding you to our team! Please contact Michelle Weishaar at 815-802-8123 or Juli Gereg  at 815-802-8122 if you would like to join.</p></div></div>
