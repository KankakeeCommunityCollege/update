<p>Last year many KCC Physical Therapist Assistant students, friends, and family participated in the annual Options Center for Independent Living (CIL) Wheel-A-Thon. </p>
<p>It’s that time of year again, and I would like to challenge us to increase our participation. Last year we had 22 participants on five teams and raised over $900! I think we can do more this year – with a goal of 10 teams of four! Also, this year they have added a Walk-a-Thon.</p>
<p>Options CIL increases opportunities for people with disabilities to live active, independent lives and to participate in our community. It is a great organization to support. One hundred percent of the net proceeds from the Wheel-a-Thon/Walk-a-Thon provide funding to local residents of Kankakee County.</p>
<p>Join the Physical Therapist Assistant program and KCC Health Careers at this fun and purposeful event on Saturday, Sept. 14, 2013. Encourage your friends and family to participate as well!</p>
<p><strong>Event details</strong></p>
<p>Date: Saturday, Sept. 14<br />9 a.m. – Registration/packet pick up/visit exhibit booth area &amp; decorate your wheelchair!<br />10 a.m. – Wheel-a-Thon/Walk-a-Thon officially rolls off<br />11 a.m. – Post party/awards</p>
