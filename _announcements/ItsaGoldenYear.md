<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass5F441807179F424F94CEFF39188674E4"><p><span style="color:blue">Submitted by: Kari Nugent, director of Marketing and Public Relations</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue"></span>The college officially turns 50 on Oct. 8, 2016, the anniversary of the KCC state charter. Plans are underway for a year-long celebration. </p>
<p><img alt="50logoWbanner.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/50logoWbanner.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />With more than 14,000 graduates since our first class, you likely know our grads and alumni. They educate our kids, care for us, keep order, help others and build our economy. We call it <strong style="color:#00558d">The Power of Community</strong> – in fact it’s our tagline for the 50th year. </p>
<p>Last year we convened a planning committee with college-wide representation to determine ideas for the celebration. After ideas were collected from faculty, staff and students, a planning team narrowed the list to several activities and events, which are described below.</p>
<p>We’ve even involved area businesses. Locally made sips and treats were created to celebrate with KCC this year. There will be a special KCC cupcake at Nana’s Cakery in Bradley and a special craft brew from Brickstone Brewery. The cupcakes and Cavaliers craft brew will be served at our receptions and gala this year.</p>
<p><strong style="color:darkred">What do we need you to do?</strong><br />We want you to know what’s happening and have fun during the 50th year. We hope you share our enthusiasm and share the college’s history and students’ success with your family, friends and neighbors.  Be our advocates in the community – our ambassadors. Educational attainment is correlated with successful communities. We want our community to understand what KCC does – here are a few points to ponder:</p>
<ul><li>More local high school graduates choose KCC than any other college</li>
<li>KCC prepares students for the first two years of a bachelor degree and for entry into the workforce.</li>
<li>KCC builds custom workforce training for business and industry.</li>
<li>KCC develops academic programs that meet employer needs.</li>
<li>KCC offers GED and adult education classes at no charge to students.</li></ul>
<p>Stories are even more memorable. Take a look at our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/KankakeeCommCollege">YouTube channel</a> and share the college’s stories, like the recent one featuring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfMnPuJk5oM&amp;feature=youtu.be">Robert DeOliveria</a>, the 2016 KCC Foundation Distinguished Alumnus. </p>
