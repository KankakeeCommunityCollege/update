<p>Little changes can go a long way when you join KCC's Weight Watchers At-Work series. Though the series just started, it’s not too late to join. We’re meeting most Wednesdays through Jan. 28 from 12:15-12:45 p.m. in Room L279.</p>
<p><a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Fall_2014_JAW_Join_Anytime_Series_female_FALL.pdf">See flier for all details.</a></p>
<p>Seventeen members are a part of the program this time. During the meeting we eat lunch together and talk about the little changes that get big results, and our challenges and successes. We also swap meal ideas and recipes, get to know one another and build friendships. And, we’re losing weight! Since January 2014 the group has lost more than 400 pounds. </p>
<p>Cost to join is $186 and includes the 17-week series plus free e-Tools, the Weight Watchers online tool kit. As a part of the college’s Concierge Services, a 25% discount is available for full-time KCC employees. Payroll deduction is also available for all employees, or you can take advantage of Weight Watchers three-part payment plan. </p>
<p>As an added bonus, members who can’t make our Wednesday meetings are able to attend any Weight Watchers meeting in the area.</p>
<p>Join us for lunch at one of our Wednesday meetings. If you want to become a member, or just have questions, give me a call at 815-802-8256 or email me at <a href="mailto:knugent@kcc.edu">knugent@kcc.edu</a>. See how little changes can make a big difference.<br /></p>
