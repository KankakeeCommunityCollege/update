<p>KCC is just $120 shy of reaching our goal of $16,000 for this year's United Way campaign.</p>
<p>There are just over two weeks remaining in this year’s campaign. Now is the time to make a financial contribution if you haven't already. Please complete and return the <a href="/FacultyStaff/departments/hr/Documents/2015-2016%20United%20Way%20Pledge%20Form.pdf">attached UW pledge form</a> tot he Human Resources Office.</p>
<p style="color:darkred"><strong>Wheels and more tickets</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations to the following employees who each won a UW Wheels and More raffle ticket following a $20 jeans donation this week:</p>
<ul><li>Linda Chouinard</li>
<li>Lupita Sorich</li>
<li>Michelle Hasik</li>
<li>Jeni Chaffer</li>
<li>Jamal Hawkins</li>
<li>Marcy Mallindine</li>
<li>Janet Fager</li></ul>
<p>For those who participated in Denim Jeans Week but unfortunately did not win a Wheels and More ticket, there is still a chance to purchase one for $100. </p>
<p>Only 2,000 tickets will be sold before the drawing on March 31. You would have great odds to win a $30,000 car. There are more than 15 secondary prizes such as a night out in Chicago (entertainment, hotel and dinner), Bulls tickets, a local theatre package, Keurig coffee maker, iPad, Sox tickets, Cubs tickets, three years of oil changes, local golf package and much more! Each ticket comes with a coupon book with more than $800 in value from local restaurants and businesses. To purchase a ticket, please see David Cagle by March 25.  </p>
<p>The local United Way campaign closes March 31 in conjunction with the United Way Annual Dinner. </p>
<p>Once again, we thank you for your continued support of our local United Way!</p></div></div>
