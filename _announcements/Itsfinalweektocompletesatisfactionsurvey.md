<p>Three down, one to go. No, this isn’t a sports metaphor, it’s the number of weeks the Employee Satisfaction survey has been open: &quot;three&quot;; plus one more week to go.</p>
<p>So far, 133 employees have completed the survey. Our goal is 210 employees, so we are at 63 percent.</p>
<p>We are encouraging all full-time employees, current adjunct instructors, and part-time employees averaging 16 hours or more of work per week to complete the employee satisfaction survey. It was send the morning of Feb. 2. Completing the survey should take about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>This is the sixth year we have used Noel Levitz to administer the survey. It allows for confidentiality, ability to compare between years to see how we are doing, and a means to compare ourselves to approximately 30 other community colleges across the nation.</p>
<p>So if you haven’t taken the survey as of yet, please do so sometime this week – the survey is scheduled to close at 11:59 pm Saturday, Feb 28.</p>
