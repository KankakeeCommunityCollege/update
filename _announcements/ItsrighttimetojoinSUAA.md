<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassC99726611EDA4BFD87D25629D7637F36><div><font size=2><font color="#0000ff">Payroll deduction now available</font> <br>From: David Cagle, director of human resources <br> <br>    If you are not currently a member of SUAA, the State Universities Annuitants Association, there is no greater time to join than now. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    SUAA is a 501(c)(4) organization created to advocate for current employees, retirees, their spouses and their survivors who will or who are receiving benefits from the State Universities Retirement System (SURS). </div>
<div><br>    SUAA was founded in 1971 as a voluntary membership organization and continues its vigilance to preserve and protect the pension system, the healthcare plans and all other benefits for the well-being of the 208,000 SURS participants and beneficiaries. </div>
<div><br>    Every year, hundreds of bills are proposed in the state legislature, portions of which would negatively impact SURS members. SUAA reads every bill to find these sections and advocate against them. Every additional SUAA member increases their political clout -- which is absolutely critical in today's political and fiscal climate.</div>
<div><br>    Please see the webpage 5 Reasons to Join SUAA. <br>    Membership fees can now be paid through payroll deduction. Membership is $34 a year, and can be deducted equally in the amount of $1.70 per pay period over 20 pay periods.</div>
<div><br>    To join and have membership dues deducted through payroll, please go to O:\Share\KCC\Human Resources\HR Forms\SUAA AUTHORIZATION TO WITHOLD. </div>
<div><br>    Submit the completed form to Jane Clark in Human Resources, Room L232.<br></div></font></div></div>
