<ol><li>A big thank you to those who have made donations, and</li>
<li>A reminder that there is still time to give and be eligible for campaign perks.</li></ol>
<p><img alt="thankyou.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/thankyou.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />So far, the Employee Giving campaign has reached 85 percent of its $22,000 goal. Ninety-nine people have made pledges. The United Way drive has reached 84 percent of its $16,000 pledge goal, and 73 people have given so far.</p>
<p>Everyone who donates is invited to the unified campaign closing celebration from noon - 2 p.m. Thursday, Nov. 19 in Room D300. An Italian deluxe pasta buffet lunch will be provided.</p>
