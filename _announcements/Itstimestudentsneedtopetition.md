<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    April 1, 2011 is the priority date for students to complete their Petition to Graduate for commencement on May 14.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    So far, approximately 230 of the expected 450 students have petitioned. Students who already have met the graduation requirements or who plan to meet the requirements by the end of the spring semester or summer term 2011 should petition. Petition forms are available in Student Services.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    It would be helpful if faculty could make general announcements in classes about petitioning to graduate, or encourage students who may be planning to graduate to petition immediately.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    Please also encourage students to make appointments with their academic advisors to verify graduation requirements.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    Students need to petition early because considerable lead time is needed to verify all graduation requirements, order diplomas and announcements, prepare programs and size caps and gowns. Late petitions still will be processed, but only as time permits. </span><span style="display:none;font-size:10pt"></span></p>
