<div>For six years the Room L355 Academic Division office staff and the Admissions and Registration office staff have invited other areas on campus to join the annual Halloween competition.</div>
<div><br />The contest will be on Halloween, Wednesday, Oct. 31.</div>
<div><br />&quot;The entire campus has been invited to participate for several years now and there has been some stiff competition in the past,” said Alison Nakaerts, one of the competition organizers. &quot;Everyone really stepped up their game last year.  We look forward to all the new competition and hope you will join us! So gather your co-workers and get working on your theme for this year.&quot;</div>

<p>Each area's theme must be kept under wraps to keep the competition from borrowing ideas. As an incentive, the winning department will keep the “Fabulous” Traveling Tacky Trophy (shown at left) and will be able to show it off until the 2013 competition.</p></div>
<div> </div>
<div>There also will be a Traveling Tacky Trophy for best costume.</div>
<div>If your department or staff in your area would like to get into the spirit of the day, please let Alison know at <a href="mailto:anakaerts@kcc.edu">anakaerts@kcc.edu</a> or 815-802-8654 by Oct. 26.</div>
