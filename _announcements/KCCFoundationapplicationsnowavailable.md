<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:black;font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'"> </span><span style="font-size:10pt;color:black;font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'">    The KCC Foundation now has applications available for more than 75 scholarships, worth more than $200,000, which will be awarded for the 2011-12 academic year.</span></p><span style="font-size:10pt;color:black;font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'">
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    &quot;It is humbling to know that others believe in you and want you to succeed,&quot; said Kelly Cantwell of Momence, recipient of the 2010-11 Reddish Family Scholarship. &quot;I look forward to the day when I am in a position to pay it forward and help others achieve their goals in life.&quot;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    Cantwell's sentiments are not uncommon among scholarship recipients.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    &quot;The help I received from your foundation makes me look forward and think positively about my future,&quot; said Humberto Téllez Lopez of Bradley, recipient of the 2010-11 Ric Edwards and Sonia Baspiñeiro-Edwards Scholarship. In thanking the Edwards' for their scholarship support, Téllez Lopez said &quot;I will push myself to work harder and show you that your help was not wasted in somebody who does not appreciate your effort of helping students.&quot;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    April 8 is the deadline to submit applications for most 2011-12 scholarships.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    &quot;We find that students sometimes don't apply, thinking they won't receive an award,&quot; said Rebecca Wilder, coordinator of scholarships and annual giving for the KCC Foundation. &quot;I don't think anyone should assume they won't qualify. Scholarships are available for a wide range of students. Some scholarships are based on grades, while others focus on factors like a student's major, potential, interests etc. If a student can maintain a minimum GPA of 2.5, it's worth applying for an award. They might be pleasantly surprised.&quot;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    Becky also encourages students to be careful and thorough when putting together their application. </p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    &quot;The KCC Foundation Scholarship Booklet and application include guidelines for submitting an application. These guidelines are the key criteria we use when reviewing candidates,&quot; Becky explained. &quot;Students applying for awards should take great care to make sure they provide all required materials, and to heed each award's descriptions for any other special requirements.&quot;</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    Scholarship categories address the needs of full- and part time students, occupational and baccalaureate students, middle-income families, recent high school graduates, students whose grades are in the middle range, older students who are returning to school, and a broad spectrum of students with special talents.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    Descriptions of all scholarship categories are available in KCC's Office of Financial Aid, from high school counselors and online at <a href="/scholarships">www.kcc.edu/scholarships</a>. Applications and nominations for any of the scholarships should be made directly to KCC's Foundation office.</p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    The scholarships are awarded to new and returning KCC students. To be eligible for most foundation scholarships, a student must reside in the college district and have a 2.5 GPA for talent scholarships. </p>
<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><br>    For more information, contact the KCC Foundation at 815-802-8250 or visit <a href="/scholarships">www.kcc.edu/scholarships</a>.</span></p>
