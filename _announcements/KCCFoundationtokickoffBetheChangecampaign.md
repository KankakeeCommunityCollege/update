<div><em><font color="#000080">“Be the change you wish to see in the world.” – Mahatma Ghandi</font></em></div>
<div><br />Every student’s needs are different. Some students need scholarships to pay for their education. Others need assistance in gaining access to technology. And many need help overcoming emergency situations that hinder their education. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Whatever our students needs are we want to help remove barriers so that they can be successful. You can bridge the gap, and make dreams into realities by being a part of the 2012 “Be the Change” Employee Giving Campaign. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>”Be the Change” will kick-off a week long “open enrollment” period beginning with two informational sessions on Aug. 23. The sessions will be held from 7:30-8:30 a.m. and 4-5 p.m. in the Iroquois Room. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The 2012 KCC Employee Giving Committee chose Mahatma Gandhi’s quote to inspire positive change for students,  and the community that we serve. Employees who participate in the campaign can designate their support to one or more of four initiatives:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>• Student Success<br />• Program Excellence<br />• Emerging Needs<br />• College Improvement Fund</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The goal of the campaign is to gain 100 percent employee participation. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Any gift you give, in any amount will create positive change. Your support sends a message to our corporate partners, our community, and our alumni, that those closest to the college believe in its mission and are willing to support it financially. Your support encourages others to participate. Calendar appointments will be sent to all employees for both Aug. 23 sessions. Employees are asked to accept the appointment that works best for their schedule, and decline the other. Sessions will be brief and refreshments will be served. </div>
