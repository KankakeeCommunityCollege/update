<div><br />Kankakee County has its first LEED Gold building.</div>
<div><br />On Aug. 1, KCC learned that its North Extension Center at 450 N. Kinzie Ave. in Bradley has earned LEED Gold certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.</div>
<div><br />LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification gives a building a score based upon its environmentally-friendly attributes and looks at a facility comprehensively, considering site issues, water efficiency, energy efficiency, materials use and indoor environmental quality.</div>
<div><br />“One of our responsibilities is to demonstrate to our community the feasibility and benefits of energy efficiency and renewable energy,” said Bert Jacobson, KCC dean of environmental and institutional sustainability. “Constructing the first LEED GOLD building in Kankakee County gives our community a concrete example of what that means, and supports and encourages other similar community construction projects.” </div>
<div><br />The two-story, 18,350 square foot building includes at least 10 features which were planned out to ensure energy efficiency. Among the ways it leans lightly on the environment, the center has a white synthetic roof, photovoltaic panels, geothermal heating and cooling, radiant floor heating, automated temperature controls, abundant natural light, light sensors and an electric vehicle charging station. The building was designed by Demonica Kemper Architects of Chicago.</div>
<div><br />The North Extension Center opened to the public in February 2014. On two floors, there is a computer lab, testing room, adult education and GED preparation classrooms, conference room, five classrooms for credit division courses, three instructional rooms for the new massage therapy program and staff offices. In addition to classes, the center is home to the Small Business Development Center and Workforce Services offices, offering job search assistance and other services. Financial aid information, placement testing, KCC class schedules and catalogs are also found at the center.</div>
<div><br />In 2007, KCC signed the American College and University President’s Climate Commitment. The college also participates at the gold level in the Illinois Sustainable University Compact. As part of these commitments, all new college construction will be built to the U.S. Green Building Council’s LEED Silver standard or higher.</div>
<div><br />For information on the college’s sustainability efforts, contact Jacobson at 815-802-8242 or email <a href="mailto:bjacobson@kcc.edu">bjacobson@kcc.edu</a>.</div>

<div><br />• A white synthetic rubber roof helps reflect the sun and reduce the heat load. The exterior walls and roof have a high insulation value (R-26 for exterior walls and R-34 on the roof).</div>
<div><br />• Low volatile organic compound (VOC) materials were used where applicable (paints, flooring, adhesives). “Green” cleaning solutions are being used. </div>
<div><br />• Radiant-floor heating and cooling in the lobby means less airborne particle movement.</div>
<div><br />• Sensors aid in the efficient use of electric lighting in the building. Skylights and windows provide 90% of the building with views of the outdoors, which reduces the need for artificial lighting.</div>
<div><br />• Thermal controls are computer-automated so fans and temperatures can be scheduled and adjusted based on building occupancy.</div>
<div><br />• Water systems inside and out reduce potable water consumption. Landscape choices are optimized to have low watering needs.</div>
<div><br />• By producing 5% of the buildings electric power, solar photovoltaic panels improve the building’s energy performance beyond standards for commercial buildings in the U.S.</div>
<div><br />• Construction materials from local and regional sources were used whenever possible. Following demolition of the previous building on the site, construction material was recycled and soils were reused when possible.</div>
<div><br />• 13 geothermal vertical loops drilled 500 feet into the ground heat and cool the building by taking advantage of the ground’s constant temperature of 55 degrees Fahrenheit. Water circulates through the loops and cools the building in summer and heats it in winter. <br />• For residents of the northern part of KCC’s district, the North Extension Center brings KCC services and classes closer to home. Regular bus service and five bike racks makes this location accessible, too. </div>
<div><br />• The parking lot has a charging station for electric vehicles.</div>
