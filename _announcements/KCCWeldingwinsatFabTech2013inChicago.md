<p>KCC’s team won “Welding Wars,” held Nov. 20 and 21 at McCormick Place in Chicago during the FabTech convention. Competing teams fabricated a birdhouse using supplied prints and welding processes gas-tungsten arc welding, gas metal arc welding and plasma cutting, with sheared and cut material provided, within a time limit of two hours.</p>

<p>According to KCC’s team of Austin Raetz, Jeff Anderson and Garrett Harris, one key to success was practice.</p></div>
<div>“We got together and practiced,” Raetz said. “We used the print-off from the American Welding Society site. When we went in, we knew what was going on.</div>
<div><br />“We went in with a very solid plan,” the Bradley resident said. “We just helped each other. We ended up being the fastest team. Everything just flowed together.</div>
<div><br />“It was something we really hoped for, but to have it happen, the feeling is awesome. I’m still just all smiles from ear to ear.”</div>
<div><br />Raetz is currently enrolled at KCC in the gas tungsten arc welding course, and he works at Tern of the Wheel in Bradley.</div>
<div><br />The other two team members, Anderson and Harris, are KCC graduates. Anderson lives in Bradley and works for Depke Gases and Welding of Kankakee. Harris, a Bourbonnais resident, is a partner in Joliet Auto Parts, located in Joliet.</div>
<div><br />“We practiced the identical project,” Harris said. “We mimicked exactly what we had to do at the competition. Every time we practiced, we learned a major thing. The day of the competition, it all went perfectly.</div>
<div><br />“We had a lot of pictures and interviews (after winning). We were treated like movie stars for about an hour.”</div>

<p>For finishing first, Harris, Raetz and Anderson each received a new Tweco multi-process welder, valued at about $2,000, plus other prizes.

<div>“During the competition, we were really calm … having fun like we normally would,” Anderson said. “We went up against some other good colleges. The college that finished second is pretty ‘big-time’ in welding. And we beat them. I thought that was pretty amazing.”</div>
<div><br />The second and third place teams were Ferris State University of Big Rapids, Mich. and Moraine Valley Community College of Palos Hills. Another team in the field of 13 was the Local 597 Pipefitters Union representing pipe fitters in Chicago and Ottawa.</div>
<div><br />Judges were certified welding inspectors, who evaluated all weldments to American Welding Society D1.1 standards, which are the requirements for fabricating and erecting welded steel structures. Other factors for judging were matching the project specifications, weld size, overall weldment appearance, craftsmanship, professionalism, and safety.</div>
<div><br />Each team member attributed the victory to practice sessions and guidance from KCC’s welding faculty, which is led by Mark Stevenson.</div>
<div><br />“I’d like to thank Mark Stevenson and Depke and my teammates,” Anderson said.</div>
<div><br />“Mark Stevenson has been a huge inspiration,” Raetz said.</div>
<div><br />“Big thanks go to our teachers, Mike Spangler and Mark Stevenson,” Harris said. “That’s who I give the credit to.”</div>
<div><br />“They beat a lot of heavy hitters,” Stevenson said. “They were not intimidated by the level of competition. They were very excited to win, but also very humbled. We were and still are a little bit in shock.”</div>
<div><br />KCC offers a number of welding training options. The program has a two-year associate degree, an advanced certificate and four certificates. There are a range of welding courses offered, such as Introduction to Welding, Advanced Arc Welding, Pipe Welding, Metallic Inert Gas Welding and Tungsten Inert Gas Welding.</div>
