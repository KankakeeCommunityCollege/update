<div><br />
<div style="float:left;margin-right:6px"><img alt="Metamorphosis" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Metamorphosis.jpg" /></div>
<p>The oil painting is <em>Metamorphosis</em>, by Oscar Martinez, an artist who was part the Hispanic Heritage Art Exhibit in the KCC art gallery in the fall of 2010. </p></div>
<div><br />“The new painting is showcased nicely in the front reception desk lobby on the wall west of the entrance doors,” said Jean Janssen, KCC art professor. “Please come and enjoy this new addition to our campus.”</div>
<div><br />A dedication of <em>Metamorphosis </em>will be held in the fall, Jean said. </div>
<div><br />Martínez is a Chicago resident and he has a Bachelor of Science in medical art from the University of Illinois Medical Center. He has had numerous group and solo exhibitions throughout the Caribbean, Mexico, and the Southeastern and Midwest regions of the U.S. Among his many credits, his work has been shown in the Museum of Bellas Artes and the National Historical Museum in Mexico, the Field Museum in Chicago, the State of Illinois Museum in Springfield and its gallery in Chicago at the State of Illinois Building.  <br /></div>

<div><font color="#993300"><br /></font>My artwork is about creating the appearance of narratives and dramas that are based on reality, dreams and the imagination. This symbolic visual world is based on the illusions that help us give order to an incomprehensible world. I use a personal symbolic vocabulary or metaphors and a complex layering of time and space that are repeated to create a visual memory. This allows me to define my own sense of the metaphysical aspects of life. I use figures, shapes and forms in combination or separate to create a range of possibilities in the visual vocabulary of my artwork.<br /></div>
