<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassDDB9D80346644931B8DEB493FD1DF440"><p>​Kankakee Community College has been named one of the “greenest” colleges in the nation, and is the only community college on the list.<br /><br /><img alt="KCC Wind turbine" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/KCC_wind_turbine.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />KCC is the no. 23 on the Greenest Colleges for 2015 list, published by <a href="http://www.bestcolleges.com/">BestColleges.com</a>. The team which compiled the list reviewed more than 240 schools rated by the <a href="http://www.aashe.org/">Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education</a>. AASHE “recognizes colleges and universities that have achieved the greatest level of success with green initiatives on-campus and within in their surrounding communities. The association gauges these efforts using the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment &amp; Rating System (STARS), a voluntary system that allows different colleges and universities to report trends and track their sustainability efforts.” KCC’s STARS score is 67.94, a gold-level ranking.</p>
<p>The 50 kW Endurance Wind Turbine at Kankakee Community College was installed on May 11, 2011. Funding for the turbine was from the U.S. Department of Education and the Illinois Clean Energy Community Foundation. To date, it has saved the college more than $15,000 in electricity costs. <br /><br />“We have come a long way in the six years since we have embraced sustainability as a way to prepare students to successfully negotiate inevitable challenges and to live happy and constructive lives,” reports Dr. Bert Jacobson, dean for Environmental and Institutional Sustainability. “With over two million freshman students entering colleges every single year in the United States, higher education is a great leverage point for addressing sustainable approaches to the complex issues that affect us all.”<br /><br />The BestColleges ranking cites KCC’s range of alternative energy sources and on-site learning that includes wind-generated power; photovoltaic arrays; unique ice storage; heating ventilation and air-conditioning systems; and geothermal and solar energy.<br /><br />“Kankakee Community College encourages students and faculty to participate in aggressive recycling initiatives and conservation efforts and hopes to make Kankakee synonymous with sustainability,” according to the listing at <a href="http://www.bestcolleges.com/features/greenest-universities/">www.bestcolleges.com/features/greenest-universities/</a>.<br /><br />The ranking also is based partially on the Advanced Technology Education Center at KCC, currently under construction. ATEC will be a centralized facility with hands-on technical training for sustainability-related fields.<br /> <br />KCC offers an Electrical Technology degree with a renewable energy specialization. The associate degree program includes training in wind generation, solar thermal, solar photovoltaic systems and electrical instruction.  <br /><br />Three Illinois colleges are on the <a href="http://www.bestcolleges.com/">BestColleges.com</a> list of green colleges. They are KCC, the University of Illinois at Urbana and Loyola University Chicago.<br /><br />KCC’s sustainability features are highlighted at www.kcc.edu/sustainability/.
