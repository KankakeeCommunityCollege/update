<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC87A67BEA4A948AFB978B21630AE9049"><p style="color:darkblue">​Submitted by Rich Soderquist, director of facilities and campus safety</p>
<p><img alt="POLICE SHIELD KCC_4C.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/POLICE%20SHIELD%20KCC_4C.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />Over the winter break, officers from the KCC Police Department in conjunction with members of the Kankakee City Police Department conducted Tactical Response Team (TRT) training at the Riverfront Campus. </p>
<p>Approximately 15 officers came together to discuss and coordinate combined efforts at the college. Joint officer teams engaged in various threat scenarios to better understand the campus facilities, support capabilities, and response strategies.</p>
<p>Active threat response requires a very high level of cooperation in tactics, communication, and logistics. Every threat situation is unique and can develop and end quickly, or can take a greater amount of time to contain and manage. Integrating protocols with rapid communication, and sustained support are critical for achieving a successful outcome. Opportunities to train together help develop intra-department understanding, trust, and outcomes. </p>
<p>The opportunity for the KCC Police Department to train with and learn from the expertise of the Kankakee City Police Tactical Response Team is vital in growing and sustaining the college’s campus public safety capabilities.</p></div></div>
