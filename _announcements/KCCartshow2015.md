<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass7BE65F329E04485893D70CB5CE66847E"><p>The 2015 Kankakee Community College Student Art Exhibition is on display until April 30 in the KCC art gallery on the lower level of the Harold and Jean Miner Memorial Library.<br /><br /><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/2015_combined_art.png" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />There are 125 art works by 52 students on display. The pieces are from a wide range of styles and mediums, including self-portraits, expressionistic color paintings, ceramics, black and white drawings and photographs, artwork made from wood, wire, plaster and discarded items.<br /><br />“This diverse display includes a variety of artwork made by KCC students <br />taking art studio classes, and includes drawings, paintings, photography, and two and three-dimensional designs,” said KCC Professor Jean Janssen. “The works are unique and very expressive; you can see traditional black and white still-life and studies in color theory, and less conventional work such as small sculptures made from cardboard and wire.” <br /><br />The gallery hours are 7 a.m. - 8 p.m. Monday through Thursday; 7 a.m. - 4 <br />p.m. Fridays; and 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. Saturdays.<br /><br />The public is invited to a reception for the artists from 6:30-8 p.m. Thursday, April 30. Refreshments will be served.<br /><br />Students in the college’s Three-Dimensional Design classes also will have &quot;Art on Campus&quot; outdoor and indoor installations available for public viewing on <br /><br />April 30. The display is being coordinated by KCC adjunct professors Margie Sula and Patty McWilliams.<br /><br />For more information, phone the KCC Art Department, at 815-802-8718.<br /><br />Artwork shown (top to bottom):</p>
