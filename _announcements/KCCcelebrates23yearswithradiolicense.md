<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass31072055E7724B9795EDAD32BBD72B00><div> <font size=2>    In May 1988, KCC applied for a new educational FM radio station license.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    In a letter dated May 17, 1988, now-retired KCC President Larry Huffman sent a Federal Express package to H. Walker Feaster, acting secretary of the Federal Communications Commission.</div>
<div><br>    The package included one original and two copies of FCC form 340, an application for a new educational FM station in Kankakee.</div>
<div><br>    For about 19 years, the station was operated by community partners or was not on the air. </div>
<div><br>    Since 2008, the station has been WKCC 91.1 FM, a public radio format operated by the college. </div>
<div><br>    It is a non-commercial radio station that relies on support from local businesses and listener contributions. WKCC will hold its spring membership drive from May 20 to 26.  The goal for the station is 200 new and renewing members.  More information on becoming a member is at </font><a href="http://www.wkccradio.org"><font size=2>www.wkccradio.org</font></a><font size=2> or call 815-802-8230.</font></div>
<div><font size=2><br>    The station can be heard throughout Kankakee County and in portions of Will, Grundy, Livingston, Ford, and Iroquois counties in Illinois and Newton and Lake counties in Indiana. <br></div></font></div></div>
