<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE5CC79CF025D4B29815576F254BCA4F8"><div>
<div>A KCC employee is being recognized for his help re-writing and streamlining a web application used by u.select Illinois.<br /></div>
<div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>A statewide online transfer advising tool (<a href="http://www.transfer.org/">www.transfer.org</a>), u.select provides information on course equivalencies and degree requirements at participating institutions. <br /></div>
<div></div>
<div>Joshua Gregoire, manager III in the Information Technology Services Department, worked to re-write an application now called Course Import, which allows students at KCC to quickly import an unofficial transcript of their coursework into u.select to determine how those courses will transfer to other institutions. </div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>Joshua assisted with the application after he began to install it for use by KCC students. He discovered a potential security issue and then wrote the new version for KCC. His solution was shared with u.select Illinois to distribute to other colleges throughout the state.<br /></div>
<div>“It is much easier to install and increases security over its predecessor, Request Import,” said Dena Lawrence, project coordinator for u.select Illinois. “We owe KCC and Josh a debt of gratitude for their work in improving this key function!”</div>
<div><br />“It will make KCC students’ lives easier, because they won’t have to manually enter their courses,” Joshua said. “Depending on the number of courses, this could save a lot of time. This will also impact lives of IT staff (at other colleges) looking to implement Course Import. It should take much less time to set up and it requires fewer resources.”<br /></div>
<div></div>
<div>Joshua will be recognized at a meeting of Illinois u.select users on Oct. 8. In Illinois, u.select is funded through the Illinois Board of Higher Education and administered by the University of Illinois.</div>
