<div> </div>
<div>KCC employees continue to show their support of our students through the “Be the Change” employee giving campaign.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To date, KCC employees have given $18,759 to the campaign to assist students through initiatives including Student Success &amp; Leadership, Program Excellence, College Improvement, and Emerging Needs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Employee support of the campaign is not only important for its monetary value, but also in encouraging the public to support KCC. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It sends a strong message to the community when the employees of KCC believe enough in the college and its mission to support an employee campaign. Such donations demonstrate to everyone that the mission of KCC truly matters, especially to those who carry it out every day.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The goal for the campaign is based on participation. Our goal is 100% participation. So far, 33% of employees* have contributed to the campaign. New donors are welcome to contribute any time before June 30, 2013. Contributions may be made by check, credit card (Visa, MasterCard, Discover), through a one-time payroll deduction, or through recurring payroll deductions. Those wishing to contribute can fill out an online pledge form, or can stop by the Foundation office to fill one out in person.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When the annual campaign concludes on June 30, 2013 the Employee Giving Committee will provide a report on funding projects.</div>
<div><br />*Note: Originally, participation totals for the “Be the Change” employee giving campaign were calculated with as-needed staff and student workers included. The result was 19% participation. While all employees are invited to contribute to “Be the Change,” the participation total should only have reflected employees who were actually approached for a contribution. The 33% participation noted in this article reflects the recalculation.</div>
