<div><font color="#0000ff" size=2>E-mail </font><a href="mailto:rsoderquist@kcc.edu"><font color="#0000ff" size=2>rsoderquist@kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2><font color="#0000ff"> to be notified any time a directive regarding flags at KCC is received.</font></font></div><font color="#0000ff">
<div><br></font><font size=2>Following is the protocol KCC uses regarding display of the U.S., Illinois and college flags. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>At the main riverfront campus, the college displays three flags by the entrance to the courtyard. These flags are raised at sunrise by the campus security department, displayed during the day, and lowered at sunset. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>When approaching the campus’s central building, the national flag is displayed to the left and higher or at the same height of any other flags displayed. This is in accordance with the Federal Flag Code. The state of Illinois flag is displayed to the right of the national flag. KCC’s college flag is displayed to the right of the state flag.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>Protocol requires that if the flags were to be displayed 24 hours a day they must be illuminated with a dedicated light. The flags are to be flown every day of the year, except for inclement weather as defined in the applicable code. The flags must be displayed at the top of the flag poles unless otherwise directed by the President of the United States, the governor of the state of Illinois, or the president of the college. Flags displayed by the college at satellite centers follow the same protocols and directives as the main campus.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>Protocols for lowering the flags to half staff:</font></div>
<p><font size=2>1. The president of the United States may direct at any time that all national flags be lowered to half staff in honor of fallen individuals, in memory of national events, or for national holidays as directed. A presidential directive is always accompanied with a specific date, start time, and duration.</font></p>
<p><font size=2>Individuals recognized by the president are typically military personnel, national political or civil servants, and foreign dignitaries. An example of a national event would be 9/11 or Dec. 7. For the Memorial Day holiday, the flag is lowered until noon.</font></p>
<p><font size=2>2. KCC also follows the state of Illinois flag code. The governor may direct that the national flag and the state flag be lowered at all state buildings. State directives are always accompanied by a specific date, start time, and duration. Individuals remembered by the state of Illinois may include fallen Illinois military personnel, state and local police, fire, and emergency responders, and political and civil servants. Events and holidays are similar to national directives. </font></p>
<p><font size=2>3. The president of the college may direct the KCC flag be lowered to honor specific individuals, events, or holidays for a given period.</font></p>
<p><font size=2>To receive the details by e-mail whenever a directive is received by the college, please contact Rich Soderquist at </font><a href="mailto:rsoderquist@kcc.edu"><font size=2>rsoderquist@kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2>. He will share the information each time.<br></font></p></div></div>
