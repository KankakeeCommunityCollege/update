<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassECAB4D17602B404E862D054334B9FE43><div><font color="#993300">Notification regarding half-staff flags is available</font></div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the main riverfront campus, the college displays three flags by the entrance to the courtyard, and KCC follows appropriate protocol for their display.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The flags must be displayed at the top of the flag poles unless otherwise directed by the president of the United States, the governor of the state of Illinois, or the president of the college. Flags displayed by the college at satellite centers follow the same protocols and directives as the main campus.<br></div>
<div>When the president or governor directs that the flags be lowered to half-staff, you can be notified of the reason. To receive the details by e-mail whenever a directive is received by the college, please contact Rich Soderquist at <a href="mailto:rsoderquist@kcc.edu">rsoderquist@kcc.edu</a>. He will share the information each time.<br></div>
<div>Each directive from the president or the governor is accompanied with a specific date, start time, and duration.<br></div>
<div>Individuals recognized by the president are typically military personnel, national political or civil servants, and foreign dignitaries. An example of a national event would be 9/11 or Dec. 7. For the Memorial Day holiday, the flag is lowered until noon. Individuals remembered by the state of Illinois may include fallen Illinois military personnel, state and local police, fire, and emergency responders, and political and civil servants</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, the president of the college may direct the KCC flag be lowered to honor specific individuals, events, or holidays for a given period.<br></div>
<div>Again, to receive the details by e-mail whenever a directive is received by the college, please contact Rich Soderquist at <a href="mailto:rsoderquist@kcc.edu">rsoderquist@kcc.edu</a>. <br></div></div></div>
