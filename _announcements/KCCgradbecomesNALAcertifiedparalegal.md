<div><font size="2">A 2012 KCC graduate has earned the National Association of Legal Assistants Certified Paralegal (Legal Assistant) credential.</font></div>
<div><br />
<div style="float:left;margin-right:6px"><font size="2"><img alt="Blythe Black 2012 paralegal grad" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Blythe_Black_2012_paralegal_grad-2014.jpg" /></font></div>
<p><font size="2">Blythe Black, who now lives in Wichita, Kansas, is the first KCC paralegal graduate to have the credential.</font></p></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Black is a legal assistant of civil litigation at Joseph, Hollander &amp; Craft LLC in Wichita. She also was a paralegal intern at the Kankakee County Public Defender’s Office in fall of 2011.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“From the outset of her studies, Blythe truly represented the best and brightest of what our program offers,” said Kris Condon, coordinator of KCC’s program. “She managed full-time employment and full-time academic work with ease and, during her internship with the Kankakee County public defender, served as a first-rate ambassador for our program.”</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Black said the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program at KCC prepared her in general areas of government and the legal system, and in-depth regarding vocation-specific training. “In my opinion, the PLAS program definitely prepares you for what the legal community demands,” she said.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“Like the standards of the KCC PLAS curriculum, the NALA review materials and exam is based on federal court system rules and procedures,” Black said. “The certification exam was almost like taking PLAS coursework final exams again. If I had not completed the Advanced Certificate Program at KCC, I do not believe I would have ever passed the NALA exam. Having the educational foundation of this subject matter was critical to my success.”</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The five sections of the NALA certification exam are communications; ethics; legal research; judgment and analytical ability; and substantive law.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">KCC’s Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program is approved by the American Bar Association. KCC offers a two-year associate degree for those who plan to immediately enter the workforce and an advanced certificate for those already holding a bachelor’s degree. For graduates of the associate degree, KCC has established transfer agreements with several four-year colleges.</font></div>
