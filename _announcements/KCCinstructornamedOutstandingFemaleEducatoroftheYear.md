<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1C9174F7516D460E914178CE5980FFC6"><p><img alt="NAACPaward2015.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/NAACPaward2015.jpg" style="margin:5px" /><br />The Kankakee branch of the NAACP has awarded Latrice Johnson-Grant their prestigious Outstanding Female Educator of the Year Award.</p>
<p>Latrice teaches adult education and general education courses for KCC.</p>
<p>She said receiving the award was completely unexpected. “I am very humbled and very surprised,” she said. This is her first year at KCC. When asked about her experiences at KCC, Latrice replied, “I love it.”</p>
<p>Latrice has been a member of the Kankakee branch of the NAACP for nearly a year. She was nominated by a district principal and a student. Qualified nominees for the award are female educators in Kankakee County who have taught in the district a minimum of five years.</p>
<p>Chastity Wells-Armstrong, education chair of the Kankakee Branch of the NAACP, said the letters of recommendation—especially one received from a student--were noteworthy. “It was a heartfelt letter that spoke to Ms. Johnson-Grant's dedication to the students, her ongoing encouragement and how she provides real-life experiences to prepare the students for college,” Wells-Armstrong said.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Latrice!<br /></p>
