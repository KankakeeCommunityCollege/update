<div><br /> “The colleges, universities and trade/vocational schools on our list represent the top 15 percent of schools that do the most to embrace the military community and ensure student success on campus,” the magazine stated.</div>
<div><br /> Typically, KCC has 200 veterans who enroll each year, according to the college’s Office of Financial Aid. There currently are 130 KCC students utilizing their Veterans Affairs benefits.</div>
<div><br /> &quot;Our main role is to guide veteran students in utilizing their federal and state VA educational benefits and to encourage each of them to apply for financial aid,” said Kris Blum, a coordinator in the KCC Office of Financial Aid. “We are also able to offer referral sources within the community and state to assist them with benefits beyond education.&quot;</div>
