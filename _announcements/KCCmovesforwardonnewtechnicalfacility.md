<div>KCC is expanding its facilities to meet the growing demand for skilled workforce education and training.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After reviewing options for several locations, KCC has purchased the facility at 2580 S. Route 45-52 in Kankakee. It is about 1.5 miles from the college’s main campus, located off River Road. The purchase price was $1.28 million.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC plans to relocate its welding, machine tool, and air conditioning and refrigeration programs to the 53,000 square foot facility. The building also allows KCC to expand its offerings to include millwright and fabrication. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>“We want to help put the community back to work,” said KCC President Dr. John Avendano. “Several of our local manufacturers have vacancies to fill related to welding, machine tool, millwright and fabrication. Our mission and purpose is to be responsive to the employer needs in our community, and to educate and train our community for these jobs. These companies have vacancies offering good paying jobs in Kankakee County.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“We are excited about the expansion of Kankakee Community College’s training facility,&quot; said Leon Topalian, Nucor Steel Kankakee’s vice president &amp; general manager. &quot;As a major employer in the area, we need access to qualified workers in our community. The programs offered by KCC are vital to the creation of a high-quality workforce. We value our long-standing partnership with KCC and look forward to the opening of their new facility.&quot;</div>
<div><br />&quot;Enrollment in welding and machine tool classes are at capacity,” said Dennis Sorensen, vice president for instructional and student success at KCC. “We considered renovating and expanding our current welding facilities which were built in 1970 or building new, but we also wanted to move quickly. It was fortunate that we found a nearby location with enough space to locate the programs. With the new space, KCC will be able to educate nearly twice as many welding students, grow its air conditioning and refrigeration, machine tool and millwright programs, and expand course offerings to include fabrication.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The facility will have four classrooms, reception and office spaces, and open floor space for the instructional areas. Before offering classes, the electrical and mechanical features of the building will be upgraded to accommodate demands of the academic programs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It is projected that the first classes will be held at this facility during the Spring 2014 semester.<br /> </div>
