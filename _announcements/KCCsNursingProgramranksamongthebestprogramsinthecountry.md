<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassAA4CF0C228BE4695817B85A3200E83D6">
<div><font size="2">According to the 2013 NCLEX-RN (National Council of Licensure Exams) program report, KCC is ranked third out of 79 programs in Illinois and 56 out of 1,099 programs nationwide. Last year, KCC ranked 13 out of 75 in the state and 172 out of 1,073 in the nation. The report included two year, four year, and diploma programs.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"><br />“Our faculty has worked hard to develop a curriculum that ensures students’ success on the exam,” said Kellee Hayes, MSN, RN, CNE, director of nursing programs.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />One reason for the college’s success has been how it adapted to new National State Board of Nursing passing requirements. KCC’s pass rate stayed at 97 percent for the last two years while the national pass rate went down to 83 percent, from 92 percent.</div>
<div><br />KCC’s President John Avendano noted that students who complete the programs are prepared to do exceptionally well in the nursing field.<br />At KCC, students take the NCLEX-RN exam upon completion of the two-year associate degree in nursing program.</div>
<div><br />KCC’s two-year registered nursing program has a competitive entry process, and accepts new students each fall and spring semester. It incorporates classroom lectures, clinical experiences and lab demonstrations. The program is designed to prepare students for work in hospital departments, as well as in long-term care, home care, business and industry, outpatient clinics, public agencies, and physicians’ offices.</div>
<div><br />For information about entry requirements, consult with a KCC adviser or contact the program director, Kellee Hayes at </font><a href="mailto:khayes@kcc.edu"><font size="2">khayes@kcc.edu</font></a><font size="2"> or phone 815-802-8828.     <br />      </font></div>
