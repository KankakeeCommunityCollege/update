<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass0E4D073A54044BCA97B78E17BCC04678"><p>KCC's Speaker’s Bureau is a way to reach out to community organizations and raise college awareness.</p>
<p>Since January 2007, a number of college employees and stakeholders have offered their services to local organizations as speakers. If you have a topic you can present to community organizations, high schools, businesses, etc.,  please consider becoming a part of the KCC’s Speaker’s Bureau. </p>
<p>&quot;The speakers bureau is a valuable way to communicate with our constituents and a clever way to present information about our programs,&quot; said Kari Nugent, director of marketing and public relations. &quot;Presenters can participate based on their availability, and it's intended that they will select their own topics. Marketing can provide visual aids with general college information, but the presenter’s expertise will be the focus of the presentation.&quot; </p>
<p>Visit the <a href="/Community/Pages/speakers.aspx">speaker’s bureau page</a> for more information and a current list of speakers and their topics. </p>
<p>To learn more about participating in the speaker’s bureau, contact Liz Becvar at 815-802-8253 or <a href="mailto:ebecvar@kcc.edu">ebecvar@kcc.edu</a> with your presentation topic or title and availability.</p></div></div>
