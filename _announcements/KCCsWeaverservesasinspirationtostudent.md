<div>The Susy Schultz <em>Daily Journal </em>editorial published Jan. 4 featured  a story about Lisa Weaver, assistant director of Youth Program Services.</div>
<div><br />In the editorial, Schultz, the <em>Journal’s</em> managing editor, turns the column over to KCC student Kent Wade.</div>
<div><br />Included among the information from Wade about life in Kankakee, he also shared the following:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;In Kankakee's book, I find many pages of promise and hope.</div>
<div><br />&quot;Let me tell you one more story -- a story that made me see what a great place this can be. </div>
<div><br />&quot;In 2004, I met an angel named Lisa Weaver -- a small, quiet, blond-haired, middle-aged woman who changed my whole outlook on life. </div>
<div><br />&quot;I had just dropped out of school and decided I needed to get my GED (certification). A supervisor at the Kankakee Public Library gave me her number, and when the time came for our appointment, I stepped into her small, cramped office -- and began to have doubts. </div>
<div><br />&quot;What could this woman do for me? </div>
<div><br />&quot;Lisa walked up to me -- all 4 feet, 11 inches of her, and smiled. She shook my hand. This was the first time a white woman seemed excited to meet me, and it scared me a little. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;We talked. And my eyes wandered to the photographs on her wall. The large collage was filled with faces of different colors, genders, heights, weights and ages. 'Who are these people?' I asked. </div>
<div><br />&quot;She responded without hesitation: 'These are the people who believed they could do it. So where can I put your picture?' </div>
<div><br />&quot;Amidst all the talk about this community being a dud, being desolate, being depressed, there was this beautiful gem, this wonderful woman. </div>
<div><br />&quot;She believed in me with such certainty, more than I had ever believed in myself. </div>
<div><br />&quot;This person and this inspiration is part of the bigger reality of my community -- my Kankakee -- that I have come to know. </div>
<div><br />&quot;There is hope, and there is inspiration.&quot;</div>
