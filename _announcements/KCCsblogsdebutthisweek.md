<div>Want to find out more about the latest topics in this ever-changing world of work? Or, maybe you, like many others, find it hard to be motivated 24/7 and need a little nudge from time to time to stay focused? These are topics that just might appear within KCC’s new blogs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC now has three staff members and one student who are hosting blogs. The blogs are: “Let’s get to work,” by Emily Skelly, coordinator of career development; “The Green Academic,” by Scott Stewart, director of horticulture and agriculture programs; “Motivation…Let’s do this!”by Nancy Schunke, marketing coordinator; and “The Student Front,” by Karley Jensen, nursing student.<br></div>
<div>Join the conversation (or just check them out) at <a href="/blogs">www.kcc.edu/blogs</a>.<br></div>
<div>“The college expanded into blogging as a new method to engage our online community,” said Nancy. We are really excited about adding blogs to our current social media mix of Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.” </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For more information on KCC’s blogs or other social media sites, phone Nancy at ext.8266 or e-mail <a href="mailto:nschunke@kcc.edu">nschunke@kcc.edu</a>.</div></div></div>
