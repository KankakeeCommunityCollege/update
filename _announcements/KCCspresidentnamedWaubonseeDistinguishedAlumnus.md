<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC31DCB2C27324349801C16061C38E5CA">
<div><font size="2">KCC’s president, Dr. John Avendano, has been selected as the Waubonsee Community College  2011 Distinguished Alumnus. </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">The Distinguished Alumnus Award is given to a respected Waubonsee alumnus who has demonstrated personal and professional support of the college, its growth and development, and its mission. This honor also recognizes individuals who have documented evidence of a distinguished record in their chosen profession, of contribution and service to their community, as well as demonstration of a continued interest in lifelong learning. </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Avendano, who was a stand-out athlete at East Aurora High School, was not sure if college was for him. Waubonsee’s athletic manager and baseball coach, Dave Randall, saw Avendano’s potential and recruited him to play baseball for Waubonsee. </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Avendano excelled on the playing field, making the All-Skyway Conference Team, but a knee injury forced him to re-evaluate his priorities. </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">“When I was injured was when I truly became a student,” he said. “I knew that I needed something more than athletics.” </font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />Luckily, Avendano was back on the field not long after getting out of his cast.</div>
<div></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">He was just a few credits shy of an associate degree when he  transferred to Elmhurst College to play baseball. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">Although he did not earn his bachelor’s degree at Elmhurst, Avendano went on to earn a bachelor’s degree in exercise physiology from Northern Illinois University in DeKalb. He next completed a master’s degree in adult continuing education from NIU. </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Even with an advanced degree, he wanted to finish his associate degree from Waubonsee, which he did. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">“It was important to me to be able to say I was a community college graduate,” he said. </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">He also completed a Ph.D. at Illinois State University in educational administration and foundations.  </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">“The fact that here I was, somebody undecided on education, to be able to achieve a Ph.D. meant a lot to my parents, and it meant a lot to me,” he said. “Early on in my career, I realized community colleges were where I wanted to be. I believe in the mission and the communities we serve. It’s a passion for me. As a community college alumnus, I understand the motivations and experiences of our students. Community colleges are a great start, a great value and a great decision. We’re the best economic value in higher education.” </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Since becoming KCC's president on July 1, 2009, Avendano has served on numerous community and local economic boards, met with every local high school and principal, hosted the area legislators, and forged a strong relationship with the president of Olivet Nazarene University. He serves on the Illinois Public Community College Council of Presidents, the Grundy-Livingston-Kankakee Workforce Board, the Riverside Healthcare Board of Directors and the Economic Alliance of Kankakee County. </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Avendano and his wife, Janet, live in Bourbonnais and have three children, Michael, Nikki and Marissa. </font></div>
