<div>Nehal Eisenbart of Grant Park, a sophomore in the Radiography Program at KCC, has been selected to participate in the American Society of Radiologic Technologists 2014 Student Leadership Development Program.</div>
<div><br />Eisenbart will receive an all-expenses-paid trip to the ASRT Educational Symposium and Annual Governance and House of Delegates Meeting, June 26-29, in Orlando, Fla. In addition, she will attend two educational courses specifically designed for students and be assigned a professional mentor during the House of Delegates meeting.</div>
<div><br />“I'm very excited to attend the Student Leadership Development Program,” Eisenbart said. “I feel like it will be a great opportunity for me as a new graduate to network with radiologic professionals and meet other students as passionate about the field of radiology as I am. I am looking forward to being able to learn new information about the medical imaging world and being able to bring that knowledge back home to share with others.”</div>
<div><br />“I am extremely proud that Nehal was chosen to participate in the ASRT Student Leadership Development Program,” said Darla Jepson, director of the Radiography Program at KCC. “This is an example of how our graduates are truly the future of the medical imaging profession and how important it is for them to get involved on a national level. Nehal will have a unique opportunity to learn how the ASRT takes action on issues that affect professional practice and will be able to bring this information back to her fellow Radiography students.”</div>
<div><br />KCC offers a two-year associate degree in radiography, which trains students for careers in radiologic technology. Students who complete the program are eligible to apply for the certification exam administered by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT). Graduates are automatically eligible for a license with the Illinois Emergency Management Agency, Division of Nuclear Safety.</div>
<div><br />For more information about KCC’s Radiography Program, contact Jepson at <a href="mailto:djepson@kcc.edu">djepson@kcc.edu</a> or 815-802-8832.<br /></div>
<div>Eisenbart will be among 75 radiologic science students from around the country who were chosen for the program.</div>
<div><br />“The Student Leadership Development Program provides medical imaging and radiation therapy students with insight into the ASRT governance process,” said ASRT President Julie Gill. “While in Orlando, students will network with radiology leaders, participate in educational activities and learn from seasoned radiologic technologists. It’s a great way for students to get involved early.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The ASRT represents more than 152,000 members who perform medical imaging procedures or plan and deliver radiation therapy. It is the largest radiologic science association in the world.<br /></div>
