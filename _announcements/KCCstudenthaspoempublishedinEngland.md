<p>If you live there, an autumn day in Canterbury, England is just like any other.</p>
<p>If you are an American studying abroad for a semester, an autumn day in Canterbury, England has melodious bells sounding, ancient cobblestone underfoot, towering spires to gaze upon, and wildlife mingling among the population.</p>
<p>The American’s interpretation of such a day was penned by Kathy Mabus of Kankakee as a 16-line poem, &quot;Look Over the Garden of England, Canterbury.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was so impressed by the amount of inspiration,&quot; Mabus said. &quot;Authors are everywhere there. You can’t drop a book without hitting one.&quot; </p>
<p>A KCC student set to graduate at the end of the month, Mabus took in the sights and sounds of Canterbury as a study abroad student at Canterbury Christ Church University, living there from September to December 2008. She wrote the poem for the Canterbury Literary Arts Festival of 2008. </p>
<p>Now 18 months later, Mabus’ poem was selected for &quot;On the Line: The Canterbury Laureate Anthology, 2009-2010.&quot; The book debuts this month. Among its destinations, it will be added to the library at Oxford University.</p>
<p>&quot;I am impressed that people in England thought enough of what I wrote to want to keep it,&quot; she said.</p>
<p>The Illinois Consortium for International Studies Program offers undergraduates the opportunity to study literature, history, art and politics in a foreign land.</p>
<p>&quot;World travel and study bring remarkable stimulation to both experience and cultural understanding,&quot; said Penelope Stickney, KCC writing professor. &quot;Obviously, the pattern in Mabus' poem reflects her immediate impressions, often quickly lost as we assimilate into the daily routine.&quot;</p>
<p>While in England, Mabus completed 12 credit hours which apply toward her KCC degrees.</p>
<p>&quot;Studying abroad can be a life-changing experience for our students,&quot; said Susan LaMore, the liason between KCC and the Illinois Consortium for International Studies Program. &quot;At the very least, it is a life-enhancing experience--an opportunity qualified KCC students can explore and use to their advantage.&quot;</p>
<p>Mabus plans to graduate from KCC with two Associate in Applied Science degrees, one in Child Development – Director/Administrator Option and the other in Child Development – Education option.</p>
<p>After KCC, she plans to pursue a job in early childhood education or elementary education.</p>
