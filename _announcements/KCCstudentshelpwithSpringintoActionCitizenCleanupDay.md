<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass8A99774B7D1D46C0B80FC45C3A6EE87D><div>    <font size=2>Eighteen KCC students and three staff members participated in the Spring into Action Citizen Cleanup Day in Kankakee on Saturday, April 9.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    After thanks and encouragement from Kankakee Mayor Nina Epstein, participants gathered at the downtown Farmer's Market site and split into 10 work groups. Each group was responsible for an area of the city. The KCC students were divided into two work groups and were assigned a multi-block area to walk through and pick up litter and trash. One group, the &quot;Green Chicagos&quot; worked Chicago and Greenwood avenues from Oak Street south to Park Place. The other group, the &quot;Searchin' Merchants,&quot; covered Merchant and Station streets from Indiana Avenue east to Evergreen Avenue. They worked from about 9:30 a.m. until noon, when lunch was served for volunteers. </div>
<div><br>    &quot;Each KCC volunteer received a green sustainability T-shirt in recognition of their commitment to sustainability,&quot; said Rich Schultz, sustainability coordinator. &quot;These students should be commended for their willingness to step up and take action to improve our community!&quot;</div>
<div><br>    KCC staffers, Lindsey Fritz (coordinator of student life and development), Susan LaMore (Baccalaureate Scholars coordinator and Phi Theta Kappa advisor) and Rich Schultz (sustainability coordinator) joined members of the Baccalaureate Scholars, Phi Theta Kappa and Student Ambassadors in this effort. </div>
<div><br>    The participating students were: Sarah Dobin, Tom Pitkin, Mitchell Marcotte, Chris Osback, Victoria Byerley, Jennifer Storer, Christopher Both, Tyler Fuller, David Wittington, Brianne Bowman, Marcos Barajas, Amber Gocken, Nick Paetsch, Karley Jensen, Jessica Baron, Megan Ritter, Josie Esparza, and Alexander Knox. <br>              </font></div>
