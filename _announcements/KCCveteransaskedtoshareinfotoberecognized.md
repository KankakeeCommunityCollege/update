<div> </div>
<div>During the Veterans Day Recogntiion event Nov. 8, KCC would like to recognize employees, their spouses, and their children who have served in the military.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The college does not require employees to identify themselves as veterans, so we are asking veterans to share the information. We do not want to overlook anyone.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>To ensure accurate records, employees who are veterans, or who are married to a veteran, or have children that are veterans are asked to share the following information by email to <a href="mailto:dcagle@kcc.edu">dcagle@kcc.edu</a>: Military branch, dates of service, rank at discharge, awards (bronze star and higher), and name of conflict (if applicable).</div>
<div><br />Please send the information to <a href="mailto:dcagle@kcc.edu">dcagle@kcc.edu</a> on or before Nov. 1.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you in advance for your cooperation in identifying yourself. We greatly appreciate your dedication and service to the United States of America!</div>
