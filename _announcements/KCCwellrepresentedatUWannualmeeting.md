<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassC1FE3994A0C749EE881E7652B52C32AF><div><font size=2>From: Dr. John Avendano, KCC president<br> <br>    Last Thursday night, March 31, the United Way of Kankakee County held its annual meeting where it was announced the campaign raised $1,075,000 to benefit our local community. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    This is the biggest campaign total in the 69-year history of United Way of Kankakee County. It surpasses last year's mark of $1,055,000. This was a great accomplishment and a reason to celebrate. As president of KCC, I had even more reasons to celebrate, knowing KCC was highly represented and played an integral part in this year's success. </div>
<div><br>    For starters, KCC's very own Vicki Gardner was at the helm, serving as United Way board president. She committed countless hours over the past 12 months and the campaign could not have had this level of success without her leadership. Great job, Vicki! </div>
<div><br>    Second, this year's campaign video featured one of our students, Kent Wade, who also is a donor and partner agencies' client. Kent also spent countless hours with the United Way staff speaking to prospective donors about how he picked himself up to become a productive citizen and leader within the Kankakee community. Kent, a job well done - you made KCC proud!</div>
<div><br>    Third, KCC was honored as the ninth top employer in giving, raising $20,000. You may recall our goal was to raise $18,500. We exceeded the goal by 8.1 percent, and increased our giving by 18.90 percent from last year. Two years ago, we were the 16th top giver, and last year we were no. 13. So we continue to move up on the leader board, which is outstanding. The continuous generosity of our college community is what makes us special. Thank you to everyone who contributed this year. </div>
<div><br>    Fourth, Becky Wilder was elected to serve on the board of directors, assuming her new post at the April United Way board of directors meeting. Welcome to the new role, Becky, I am sure you will continue to favorably represent KCC. </div>
<div><br>    Last, and by no means least, our very own David Cagle was recognized as the UW Volunteer of the Year! Like Vicki, he has served on the board for the past six years and has made significant contributions to the United Way campaign. David has served as Employer Campaign Champion for the county and for KCC over the last four years. He also has been the KCC 5K for United Way race director for an event that has attracted hundreds of walkers and runners to our campus. </div>
<div><br>    In receiving this honor, it was said: &quot;David is a champion supporter of United Way. He always gives generously of his time, talent, and treasure and he inspires others to do the same His creative spirit continues to find new ways to increase resources designed to help those less fortunate in our community. The United Way and this community are blessed to have him among us.&quot; </div>
<div><br>    And I feel the same way. Great job, David!</div>
<div><br>    There were 1,403 tickets sold for the Wheels and More promotion, resulting in $140,300 being raised for the campaign. Unfortunately, none of us won the car, iPad, or Cubs/Sox tickets, but I do thank everyone who purchased a ticket. </div>
<div><br>    I'd also like to thank the faculty, staff, and retirees who made an annual pledge, who paid $5 to wear jeans on jeans day, who purchased ice cream or other quality foods from Schwan's on their fundraising days, who participated in the 5K race, or who attended the White Christmas concert where half of the proceeds were donated to the campaign. </div>
<div><br>    Thanks to all of you who have contributed! </div>
<div><br>    In bleak economic times such as the present, the demand for health and human services is greater than ever in our community, and I am proud to know KCC did its part. Thanks for fulfilling the &quot;Live United&quot; theme.                                     <br></div></font></div></div>
