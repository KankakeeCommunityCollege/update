<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass8DE2E4D6DE484CAA9B8A6ACDFBC58799"><p>​KCC is closed to the public Dec. 22-23 as the SQL migration testing continues.</p>
<p>When people call the college's main phone numbers on those days, a message will  inform them about the limited services that might be available. </p>
<p>Though we’ve shared this information with our students and the public for several weeks, a few students may still visit campus. On these days, a skeleton crew of student services, accounting  and bookstore professionals will be ready to help. Online registration is also available. As always, please do your best to provide excellent customer service. <br /><br />In addition, the building will be open like any other work day. The Harold and Jean Miner Memorial Library and the Child Development Center will be open to staff on those days as well. <br /><br />You can direct questions to the Office of Marketing and Public Relations at 815-802-8253.</p>
