<p><span style="color:darkblue"></span><span style="color:darkblue">From: Dr. John Avendano, KCC president</span><br /><br />Hello everyone!</p>
<p>Would you like to park in the first or second spots of the Prairie Lot, just outside the entrance?</p>
<p>Would you like to wear jeans every Friday throughout the year? </p>
<p>Would you like to earn a half-day or full-day off with pay? </p>

<p><img alt="United Way logo" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/United%20Way.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />Come to the kickoff of the United Way and Employee Giving campaign on Monday, Oct. 12 from 8-10 a.m. in the Iroquois Room to learn how. </p>
<p>To all of you who contributed in the past, I thank you, and I hope we can count on your support again. To those employees who haven’t yet contributed--and new employees--I encourage you to join us in our support.</p>
<p>All full- and part-time faculty, supportive staff and administrators are welcome to attend and show their support. Refreshments will be provided, and this year’s campaign video will debut. It should be entertaining.</p>
<p>As you may know by now, I love to set goals for us as an institution. This year, our goal for the Foundation Employee Giving campaign is $22,000, and the United Way goal is $16,000 – for a combined goal of $38,000. In order to reach that goal, it will take everyone's cooperation and support. </p>
<p>Please remember 99 cents of every dollar donated to United Way stays within our district. Your donations support 45 local programs and 24 member agencies, serving more than 65,000 people each year. Last year, the Foundation was awarded 178 scholarships totaling more than  $223,000!</p>
<p>During difficult economic times such as these, the demand for health and human services is greater than ever in our community, and I am proud to know KCC does its part.</p>
<p>The Employee Giving/United Way campaign will continue actively until Thursday, Nov 19. A thank you celebration will be held that day in Room D300 from 11 a.m. - 2 p.m. for those who pledged their financial support.  </p>

<p>During difficult economic times such as these, the demand for health and human services is greater than ever in our community, and I am proud to know KCC does its part. In our 50th year, the Power of Community is our theme. I hope you will join me in supporting both campaigns to make KCC and the community that we serve stronger. </p>
