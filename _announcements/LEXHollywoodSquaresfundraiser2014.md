Two contestants at a time will be chosen from the audience. They will be called on to determine if a celebrity is giving a correct answer to a general knowledge question or bluffing. To win, the contestant needs to get three correct answers arranged in-line across the tic-tac-toe board. In all, there will be eight contestants.   <br />    <br />All proceeds will be donated to Prairie State Legal Services.<br /><br />“There is an incredible need for legal assistance in the area, but this is one of the smallest offices in the state, said Dr. Kris Condon, coordinator of the KCC Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program. “Raising funds with events like this one is a simple opportunity for our students to give back.”<br /><br />Those who are scheduled to occupy the celebrity squares are: Dr. John Avendano, KCC president; Sheri Cagle, KCC associate dean of the Health Careers Division; Randy Chaplinski, senior vice president and trust officer for HomeStar Bank; Thomas Cunnington, associate judge with the 21st Judicial Circuit; Nancy Hinton, office manager and pro bono coordinator for Prairie State Legal Services; Alice “Tinker” Parker, KCC adjunct professor; Ted Petersen, KCC athletic director and two-time super bowl champion with the Pittsburgh Steelers; Dennis Marek, attorney with Ackman, Marek, Meyer &amp; Coghlan, Ltd.; and Marisa Wiesman, director of Volunteer Services for Prairie State Legal Services. Emcee will be KCC staff member Steve Makepeace.<br /><br />The event is hosted by the KCC chapter of Lambda Epsilon Chi, a national honor society in paralegal/legal assistant studies. Cost to attend is $15 per person and $5 for KCC students with ID.<br /><br />Prairie State Legal Services is a not-for-profit provider of free civil legal services for low-income and elderly residents of Kankakee and Iroquois counties when they are faced with the loss of safety, access to healthcare, income or shelter. <br /><br />For more information, phone Condon at 815-802-8216.</p>
