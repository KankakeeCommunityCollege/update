<p><img alt="LEX induction" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/LEX_induction.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />Kankakee attorney J. Imani Drew, assistant public defender for Kankakee County, was inducted into Lambda Epsilon Chi for her service as adjunct faculty, advisory committee, and ABA Reapproval Task Force, as well as for sponsoring interns. Krystel McKean, a Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies Advanced Certificate student from Bourbonnais, was also inducted.  <br /><br />Jamie Greenley, the inaugural LEX chapter president, will also be honored for her 12-year commitment. She stepped down as president this year and was replaced by Eric Curtis.<br /><br />Lambda Epsilon Chi Honor Society is a nationally-based honor society in paralegal studies that is administered by the American Association for Paralegal Education. There are only nine other Lambda Epsilon Chi chapters in Illinois.<br /><br />“The Lambda Epsilon Chi membership status pertains only to students who exemplify exceptional performance and to professionals who have served our program and its participants,” said Kris Condon, the program’s coordinator. “Imani exemplifies the ethics, both personal and professional, that we expect of our students every day. LEX membership is an honor conferred upon the best and the brightest our program has to offer. Imani has consistently done her part to guarantee that our students stay accountable to that standard.” <br /><br />Among requirements for membership in the society, each student member must have completed at least two-thirds of the program requirements, have an overall grade point average of 3.5 or higher at KCC, as well as a grade point average of 3.75 or higher in paralegal/legal assistant studies classes. In addition, applicants must submit a legal writing sample and participate in a personal interview and a timed writing activity, all of which are reviewed by the LEX Selection Subcommittee.<br /><br />Two Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies degrees are offered at KCC, a two-year associate degree program for those who plan to immediately enter the workforce or to transfer into a four-year baccalaureate degree program and a one-year advanced certificate for those already holding a bachelor’s degree.<br /><br />For more information on the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program at KCC, phone Condon at 815-802-8216 or e-mail <a href="mailto:kcondon@kcc.edu">kcondon@kcc.edu</a>.</p>
