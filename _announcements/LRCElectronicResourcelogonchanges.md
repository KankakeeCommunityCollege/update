<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassA44949F928834D81AEF45D17ABF9A7C7><div><strong>From:</strong> Tracy Hilgendorf, librarian</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Learning Resource Center has changed the procedures to log on to its electronic databases from off-campus. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When you click on any of our subscription databases (such as EBSCOhost, Expanded Academic ASAP, Newsbank, etc.), you will see a log on screen. The log on to be used on this screen is your KCC username and password (the log on you use for Angel or KCConnect).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You will only need to log on once; as long as you keep your browser window open, you will automatically be logged on to any other databases you would want to use. If you close the window, you will need to log back on for database access. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>While on campus, you will be taken directly to the database and will bypass the log on process. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you have any questions about this new service or any of the library databases, please contact the LRC at 815-802-8400 or <a href="mailto:library@kcc.edu">library@kcc.edu</a>. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are having problems logging on, please contact Information Technology Services at 815-802-8900 or <a href="mailto:helpdesk@kcc.edu">helpdesk@kcc.edu</a>.</div></div></div>
