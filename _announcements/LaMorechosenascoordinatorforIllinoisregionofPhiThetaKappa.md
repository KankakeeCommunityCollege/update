<div><br />The new coordinator of the Illinois region for Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society is from KCC.</div>
<div><br />Susan LaMore has been selected for the regional coordinator position, and will facilitate activities among the 57 chapters in Illinois. She also will be a liaison between the national headquarters and individual chapters. Phi Theta Kappa has 30 regions.<br /></div>
<div>Susan has been an advisor of the KCC Alpha Delta Eta Chapter of Phi Theta Kappa since 1996. She also was inducted into the honor society as a KCC student. </div>
<div><br />“To see the students succeed and move on toward their goals is the best job a person could have,” Susan said. “Sharing in their pride and delight when they’re eligible to join Phi Theta Kappa is just icing on the cake. As we work together throughout the year to achieve our goals, I am continually aware of how these activities will benefit them in some way in the future.”<br /></div>
<div>“In assuming the role of regional coordinator, Susan’s commitment to Phi Theta Kappa and the Illinois Region is outstanding,” said Rod Risley, Ph.D., executive director and chief executive officer of Phi Theta Kappa.</div>
<div><br />KCC’s Phi Theta Kappa chapter has been recognized with “Five Star Status” 12 times while Susan has been one of its advisors. Five star status is acknowledgment of maintaining the highest level of activity within the organization.</div>
<div><br />In 2013, Susan received the All-Illinois Advisor Team award for leadership accomplishments; and in 2012 she accepted the Horizon Award and the Hall of Honor Advisor Award for outstanding service to KCC’s chapter. She also is a certified instructor of Phi Theta Kappa’s Leadership Development Studies Course.<br /></div>
<div>Susan has an associate degree from KCC and a bachelor’s degree in management from Olivet Nazarene University in Bourbonnais. At KCC, where she has worked for 29 years, Susan also is coordinator of the transfer center and student scholar programs.<br /></div>
<div>Phi Theta Kappa has recognized academic excellence in the two-year college since 1918. It is the largest honor society in American higher education, with more than 1.5 million members in 1,285 chapters. The society offers opportunities for scholarships, intellectual enrichment, and personal development through programs based on the society’s hallmarks of scholarship, leadership, service, and fellowship.<br /></div>
