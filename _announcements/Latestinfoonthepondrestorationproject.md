<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE65637958A4A43D5944513F504CA72D8"><div><strong>From</strong> Scott Stewart, director of horticulture and agriculture programs</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The retention pond wetlands restoration project is closing out its second year.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>During the first year of restoration work, the pond was reshaped and an initial planting of native prairie and wetland plants were installed. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Year two activities included a campus community event to remove excess stone and debris from the pond edges and a second planting of native prairie seed. This second planting was designed to supplement the first year’s planting with additional native species for increased plant diversity. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As the restoration project enters its third year, significant ecological and aesthetic changes have occurred at the wetlands site. Numerous native grasses and wildflowers have established themselves—including purple coneflower, blanketflower, and several species of coreopsis. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Future management plans call for mowing the wetland slopes this fall followed by a possible spring prescribed burn. These techniques are designed to mimic the natural disturbance cycles of the native Illinois prairie ecosystem, and will result in increased native plant growth, improved flowering of wildflowers, decreased weed occurrence, and decreased need for herbicide use. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Students from the Horticulture Technology Program and Environmental Sciences classes continue to use the wetlands restoration site in their coursework, and will be working alongside college staff in a continuing effort to restore and manage the wetlands site.<br />
