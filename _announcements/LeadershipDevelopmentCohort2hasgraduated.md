<div> </div>
<div>The second cohort from the Leadership Development Program graduated May 22. Dr. John Avendano, KCC president, and Dr. Michael Boyd, vice president for instructional and student success, presented graduates with certificates of completion and Leadership Development Program pins.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dr. Avendano thanked everyone for their participation and said he is looking forward to seeing them take a leadership role in their positions at the college.</div>
