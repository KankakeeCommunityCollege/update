<div>May 17, KCC graduated the first cohort group from the revised two-year Leadership Development Program.  <br />KCC President John Avendano presented certificates of completion to 14 graduates whom, he said, represented “the future of KCC.”  </div>
<div><br />The graduates were Sheri Cagle, Linda Chouinard, Nicole Ford, Lindsey Fritz, Josh Gregoire, Kim Harpin, Jamal Hawkins, Rob Kenney, Mark Lanting, Dwayne Musick, Kelly Myers, Mike O’Connor, Dana Washington and Ken West.  </div>
<div><br />“The Leadership Development Program is an investment in developing talent within the college to assist with current and future roles at KCC,” said Bert Jacobson. </div>
<div><br />The program oversight committee is Bert, David Cagle and Rose Mitchell. </div>
<div><br />Participation in the program is a commitment to attend two years for two days and actively participate in the follow-up sessions held on campus. Upon graduation, projects will be assigned to cohort groups by the president.</div>
<div><br />This program is designed for those interested in making the investment of their time and efforts with the college’s support to enhance leadership skills to serve the college community for years to come. </div>
