<p>There are two weeks remaining to apply for the Leadership Development Program (LDP).</p>
<p>The application deadline is Oct. 31 for the cohort group which will begin its first-year experience at Starved Rock Lodge on May 15 and 16, 2013.</p>
<p>&quot;The Leadership Development Program is an investment in developing talent within the college to assist with current and future roles at KCC,&quot; said Dr. John Avendano, KCC's president. &quot;Participation includes a commitment to attend the two consecutive years of the annual two-day program, and to actively participate in follow-up sessions.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon completion of Years One and Two of the LDP, participants will graduate.</p>
<p>&quot;This program is for those interested in investing time and effort -- with the college’s support -- to enhance leadership skills that will serve the college community for years to come,&quot; Dr. Avendano said.</p>
<p>Graduates of the LDP will be given projects by the president. Opportunities for professional development will be shared with all LDP participants.</p>
<p>The application is at O:\Share\KCC\LDP\LDP Application and Program Criteria.</p>
<p>If you are up to the challenge to contribute to the advancement of KCC as an institution of higher learning, please submit your completed application to David Cagle at <a href="mailto:dcagle@kcc.edu">dcagle@kcc.edu</a> by Oct. 31, 2012.</p>
