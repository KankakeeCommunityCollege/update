<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass2E83ADBAC37043A89A6FEAC648808A59"><p style="color:#00558d">​<span>Submitted by Barb Loudy, technician  I / library technical assistant</span></p>
<p>The Miner Memorial Library has laptops available for checkout. </p>
<p>In addition to the Teaching and Learning Center and TRiO laptops; the laptops used by general credit division students were recently replaced and now have Wi-Fi capabilities.</p>
<p>The TLC laptops can be used by faculty or staff for college business.</p>
<p>Examples include faculty working on special projects or attending KCC-approved conferences and needing access to a laptop while they are off campus.  </p>
<p>The checkout time for them is one week. When a laptop is needed for a specific date, please request it in advance and we’ll do our best to hold one for you.</p>
<p>TRiO and general students must sign a User Agreement and print a current copy of their Registration Statement before checking out a laptop. The checkout time for student and TRiO laptops is one week and no renewals are allowed. To avoid paying late fees, students must pay close attention to their due dates.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our needs occasionally outweigh our inventory. In those instances, patrons may add their name to a wait list and we will call when one becomes available.<br /></p></div></div>
