<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE3C696945B9645838CB4E046839E2A8A"><p>​The Strategic Planning Oversight Committee wants to know what students think. So, beginning the week of Sept. 18, banners will be on walls around campus asking students how we can improve their KCC experience. <a href="/Community/Collegeinfo/president/Pages/commentform.aspx"><img alt="Feedback icon" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/feedback1.gif" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" /></a></p>
<p>A virtual wall will be available in Canvas, too. Please encourage students to participate.</p>
<p>Student feedback will help formulate the college’s next strategic plan. The current plan runs until 2018. </p>
<p>“Enrollment is a challenge right now, so the SPOC committee is channeling efforts to improve it,” said Dr. Mike Boyd, vice president for instructional and student success. “We gathered input from our faculty and staff at the open forum last week, and we’re also asking students for their input.” </p>
<p>The banners will be up until Sept. 22. Employee feedback with ideas about enrollment can be shared with Mike at <a href="mailto:mboyd@kcc.edu">mboyd@kcc.edu</a>.</p></div></div>
