<div>Whether living in a yellow submarine or walking down Penny Lane, the new Magical Mystery Tour show will deliver Beatlemania to WKCC radio listeners each week.</div>
<div><br />Airing Sundays from 3-5 p.m., the new program focuses on everything related to the Beatles. The two-hour show is produced in the KCC Abbey Road – AKA River Road – studios. It will premiere on WKCC 91.1 FM on March 17.</div>
<div><br />“Each week, listeners will hear some great music and gain a greater appreciation for the ‘Fab Four’ when they hop on the Magical Mystery Tour,” said James D. Jones of Momence, the host. Jones (pictured below) has been a Beatles “tour guide” on Kankakee area radio programs since 1999. <br /></div>
