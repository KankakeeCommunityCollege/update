<div>The mailroom staff has offered the following reminders about bulk mail procedures:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>- Bulk mail must consist of a minimum 200 pieces and be ascending zip code order, with all pieces being sealed as needed.<br> <br>- All pieces must be brought to the KCC mailroom to be processed. When complete, our Security Department delivers the mailing to a bulk mail agent at the post office.<br> <br>- The post office may take up to 10 days to process bulk mail, so plan accordingly with time sensitive materials.<br> <br>- Do not put any mailings in any mailbox inside or outside of KCC. The mailing must be processed through the mailroom, then the post office.</div>
<div><br>- A bulk mail piece from KCC has the following permit information printed on each piece: U.S. POSTAGE PAID  Kankakee, IL 60901 Permit No. ###<br> <br>For assistance with bulk mail, or to ask other questions, please contact Mary Polka at 815-802-8174.</div>
