<div><br><font size=2>Country and organization displays, student and faculty presentations, videos, and an international sampler buffet are scheduled for Wednesday, March 23.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>The Cultural Diversity Committee needs your participation to make the event a success again this year. We are looking for people with international connections or travel experiences who would like to have a display table for the event. Participation is open to students, faculty, staff, and individuals from the greater community. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>&quot;Student and community organizations are invited to participate, as well,&quot; said Elise Schultz, co-chair of the Cultural Diversity Committee. &quot;For organizations, we suggest that the display should have a theme related to a particular country, culture, or global awareness.&quot;</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>If you would like to participate, please e-mail Oshunda Carpenter Williams at </font><font size=2><a href="mailto:ocarpenterwilliams@kcc.edu">ocarpenterwilliams@kcc.edu </a></font><font size=2>by March 11 with the country or theme you will represent. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>The committee will contact you prior to the event about specific planning details. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>&quot;Please encourage students, friends and family to attend,&quot; Elise said. &quot;The displays and presentations will be informative and educational. The event provides a great way to test your awareness about countries and cultures, to win prizes, and to receive coupons toward the buffet.&quot; <br></font></div></div></div>
