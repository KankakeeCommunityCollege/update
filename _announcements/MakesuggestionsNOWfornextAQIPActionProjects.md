<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass789FC0E3B2044BA8A7D198317CA02437"><div>​KCC’s <a href="/Community/Collegeinfo/ie/aqip/Pages/action-projects.aspx">three current AQIP projects</a> will be complete before the end of the Spring 2016 semester.  <br /><br />It is time to choose where to focus our institutional energy and resources for the next year. <br /><br />Please share potential projects. Projects should be adaptable to last one year, advance the college, mission, and/or strategic goals.  <br /><br />For inspiration, check out the <a href="http://apdarchive.hlcommission.org/">AQIP action project directory</a>, which has titles and summaries of every AQIP project nationwide, both completed and current! You can search by college name, or a keyword in the title. Example: Enter “student success” in the title box, and there are 84 action projects nationwide; you can click on any of them to get information on an AQIP project on student success. <br /><br /><a href="mailto:pdevol@kcc.edu"><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/feedback1.gif" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" /></a>Send your suggestions for an Action Project to <a href="mailto:pdevol@kcc.edu">Dr. Purva DeVol </a>by Friday, Feb. 12. “Feel free to recommend someone who could chair the AQIP project—better yet, recommend yourself as chair!” Purva said. <br /><br />The new AQIP projects will be selected later this spring.</div>
