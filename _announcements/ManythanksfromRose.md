<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassC9CDAA2CE4BC4F8780DDC6390779F7D5><div><strong>From </strong>Rose Devine Mitchell<br><br>I wanted to write and sincerely thank everyone for the calls, visits, gifts and cards that you have shared with me through my journey. Friday, May 20, is to be my (hopefully) last round of chemo, and I’m hoping for some truly great news after that visit. </div>
<div><br>As most of you may already know, the diagnosis was ovarian cancer, and my surgeon believes that he removed it all during the surgery of Feb. 18. The chemo was to be insurance that no nasty little micro-cells went somewhere else and took root for reproduction. </div>
<div><br>I have been blessed with an amazing husband who has been by my side through all of this, and my sisters and amazing friends have made sure that Gary didn’t go hungry and even had a few nights out. Caregivers need support too!</div>
<div><br>Thank you again everyone for your caring support and friendship. I’m hoping to get released to return to the workplace sometime in June, and I’m truly looking forward to seeing my KCC friends soon! It’s also my plan to grow some hair over the summer while Gary grows tomatoes in the garden!</div>
<div><br>Here’s wishing everyone a safe and healthy summer!<br></div></div></div>
