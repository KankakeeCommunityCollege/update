<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassD479326CEBC74D46AF5ED140DBCE9B9D"><p>The KCC Marketing Department is refocusing to assure that enrollment initiatives remain as the first priority.</p>
<p>To achieve this objective, the Marketing Department will usually have to decline requests to promote individual programs, individual courses and events. These include projects both for student groups and faculty/staff. Work will continue on initiatives that directly relate to enrollment.</p>
<p>To help with events, programs and courses, <a href="/students/studentlife/clubs/forms-templates/Pages/club-templates.aspx">templates</a> are being offered.  Several flier and poster templates are available now. Soon, sign standard and table tents will be available as well.</p>
<p>The <a href="/students/studentlife/clubs/forms-templates/Pages/club-templates.aspx">templates</a> can be completed then sent directly to print using Eprint. To set up an Eprint user account, please contact <a href="mailto:sdockemeyer@kcc.edu">Stephen Dockemeyer</a> or <a href="mailto:twheeler@kcc.edu">Tyler Wheeler</a> via email.</p>
<p>As in the past, all media inquiries—including press releases—should begin with the Marketing Department. This allows the college to maintain consistency and accuracy, and to ensure that members of the media speak with the most appropriate person.</p>
<p>Enrollment initiatives which are being focused on are college credit recruitment and retention, continuing education course enrollment and adult education enrollment.</p>
<p>From now through the end of the Fall 2015 semester, marketing projects which do not have a collegewide focus or a direct impact on enrollment are being phased out.</p></div></div>
