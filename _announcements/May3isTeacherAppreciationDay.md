<div><font size=2>    On Teacher Appreciation Day, May 3, we thank teachers for their hard work and the impact they have made in our lives.<br>    Many of us could echo the sentiments of the anonymous author of &quot;A Parent's Note to a Teacher&quot;: <br> <br>    <br>I'm the voice of a grateful parent<br>    whose child was in your class...<br>    the one who needed help to find his way <br> <br>    <br>You've been a special blessing<br>    as you helped my child succeed<br>    and I'm thankful for the part you had to play <br> <br>    <br>You gave him so much more<br>    than just the lessons in the books<br>    you gave him wings...so he could learn to fly <br> <br>    <br>You ignited a flame within his soul<br>    a passion to learn and grow...<br>    to never give up and always be willing to try <br> <br>    <br>Your encouragement inspired him<br>    and your kindness was so real<br>    but the thing that thrills my heart the most is this... <br> <br>    <br>By building his self-confidence<br>    you changed his life this year<br>    he believes in himself...and a brighter future is his! <br> <br>    <br>Again, thank you to all KCC instructors!<br></font></div></div></div>
