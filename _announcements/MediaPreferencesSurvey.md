<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass5AD885D2A3EF4D418A74FCA754B2B60B"><p>From Kari Nugent, director of Marketing and Public Relations</p>
<p>We have a unique opportunity to learn more about our students through a media preferences survey. </p>
<p>In the coming weeks, our students will be invited via email to voluntarily participate in the survey. It asks them questions about their media preferences and what they like to do with their time. Questions like “what is your favorite radio station,” “what information do you look for in the newspaper,” and “how often do you go to a coffee house/shop.” As you know, these types of questions can provide critical information for marketing our college and our programs in a more cost-effective manner. They can help target recruitment efforts for your programs.<br /><br />The more students who participate, the better information we’ll receive. It would be very helpful if you would please make an announcement in your classes encouraging students to look for the email invitation and participate. They can even win a $150 Amazon Store Gift Certificate!<br /><br />Some key points to tell students:<br />• It is voluntary<br />• It is anonymous<br />• It takes between 25-30 minutes, depending upon internet connectivity and their computer skills<br />• At the end of the survey, students can enter a drawing to win a $150 Amazon Store Gift Certificate (they will be directed to a different web site for the drawing).<br /><br />This is a wonderful opportunity to gather some very helpful information from our students that will assist with more effective marketing and future planning for our college. Thank you in advance for your participation in these efforts.<br /><br /><br /></p></div></div>
