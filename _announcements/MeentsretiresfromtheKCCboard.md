<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass0C61C0B98CC348C68FDC110B084F8382"><p>​Betty Meents has retired from KCC’s board of trustees after 39 years of service. <br /><br /><img alt="Betty Meents and Dr. John Avendano" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Betty_Meents_and_Dr._John_Avendano.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />The Watseka resident was the college’s longest-serving trustee. She served on the board from April 1976 to January 2015. KCC will host a reception to honor Meents in the spring.<br /><br />“Through leadership and guidance, Betty helped KCC grow to become a well-respected and fiscally-strong institution,” said KCC’s president, Dr. John Avendano. “Her insights, perspective, support and commitment to the college will be greatly missed.” <br /><br />“My proudest moments have been sitting on the stage and watching the students accept their diplomas on graduation day,” Meents said. “Seeing the smiles of accomplishment on their faces and hearing the cheers from family and friends is rewarding. <br /><br />“I feel so many students are able to attend KCC because of the low tuition and because of the many KCC Foundation scholarships and grants which are available. The community college system enhances the lives of so many. I take pride in serving on the KCC board.<br /><br />“I have enjoyed working with the board of trustees and the great minds of four presidents (Dr. L.H. Horton, Dr. Larry Huffman, Dr. Jerry Weber and Dr. John Avendano). Our KCC faculty and staff are superb as well. My 39 years have been very satisfying.”<br /><img alt="Cathy Boicken" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Cathy_Boicken.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" /><br />At the January 2015 meeting, Cathy Boicken was appointed to complete Meents’ term on the board. Boicken is president and chief executive officer at Municipal Bank in Bourbonnais. She is a KCC graduate and also has a bachelor’s degree from Olivet Nazarene University. <br /><br />“As a graduate of Kankakee Community College, I know firsthand the quality educational opportunities Kankakee Community College affords students of all ages, said Boicken. “I am honored to have the opportunity to help insure KCC continues to offer excellent educational opportunities at an affordable cost.”<br /><br />In addition to the KCC board, Boicken is an active community volunteer and has led a number of charitable initiatives. She currently serves on the KCC Foundation board and Hospice of Kankakee County. <br /><br />Boicken, her husband Terry and their daughter live in Bourbonnais.<br /> <br />***</p>
