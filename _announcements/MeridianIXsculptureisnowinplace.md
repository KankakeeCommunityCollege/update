<div><font size="2">A new sculpture now welcomes students and visitors to Kankakee Community College.<br /></font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">“Meridian IX,” created in memory of renowned poet Paul Celan, now greets visitors to the campus south of Kankakee. The sculptor is Ed McCullough.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />The sculpture will be dedicated during a ceremony at 2 p.m. Thursday, Oct. 6 at KCC. The public is invited.</div>
<div><br />The name Meridian has many contexts, including being a reference to McCullough’s time at sea with the U.S. Navy, serving on a submarine. Following his service, he earned both a bachelor’s and a master’s degree in art from Illinois State University in Normal.<br /></div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Meridian IX” is the ninth in the 10-part series of Meridian outdoor sculptures McCullough is creating. </div>
<div>The 10th Meridian sculpture is almost finished, and is currently in the fabrication process. It is expected to be complete by the end of the year.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Other Meridian sculptures were installed beginning in 1996. They can be found in Illinois, Wisconsin and Iowa. One other sculpture from the series can be found in Kankakee County. “Meridian IV,” installed in 2000, is in Conrad Park in Momence. It is a memorial to the late Admiral Mike Boorda, who grew up in Momence.<br /><img alt="Meridain IX" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Ed_McCullough_Meridian_IX_LI-KKK-Ed-002.jpg" /> “Meridian IX” is 9 feet 6 inches high and 16 feet in diameter, and it sits on a round concrete pad which is 32 feet in diameter.</div>
