<div> </div>
<div>Periodically, Information Technology Services will get requests from employees regarding using Microsoft Office on their computers at home.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The program that allows us to do this is called the Microsoft Home Use Program and is provided to KCC as part of our Microsoft software license agreement. This agreement allows KCC faculty and full-time staff to access a copy of Microsoft Office and install it on a single, home use computer, either a laptop or standalone system, but not both.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For additional information on this program, please visit ITS’ <a href="/students/helpful/it/staff/Pages/mshup.aspx">Microsoft Home Use Program web page</a>. There, you will find the eligibility requirements and instructions on downloading the software.<br></div></div></div>
