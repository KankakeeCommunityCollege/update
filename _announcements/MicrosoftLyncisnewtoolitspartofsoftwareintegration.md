<div><strong>From:</strong> Michael O’Connor, director of Information Technology Services</div>
<div><br>Many of you may recall that at various times last spring, I spoke about the college's move to a single software platform, Microsoft. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>One of the primary reasons for doing this was to reduce software licensing costs, but another compelling reason was the ability to integrate the various software applications that we use on campus.</div>
<div><br>Our initial integration step is the introduction of Microsoft Lync. Microsoft Lync is a collaborative, communication client that allows for various forms of communication including instant messaging; email integration; conferencing; screen sharing; and &quot;presence,&quot; the ability to determine someone's availability.</div>
<div><br>Lync integrates directly with Microsoft Outlook, so you do not to have to go into the Lync software application to access its features. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Instead, you can access features such as presence and instant messaging directly within Microsoft Outlook. This can be accomplished by simply placing your mouse cursor over a users’ name and right-clicking. A smart menu will appear providing a variety of options including a contact’s status, how long he/she is available until their next meeting, communicate with contact via instant message or email, etc.</div>
<div><br>One of the best ways to discover Lync’s features and functionality is to just start using it.</div>
<div><br>The Information Technology Services Office also has a brief PowerPoint presentation available at  O:\Share\KCC\ITS Documentation\Lync Training.pptx.</div>
