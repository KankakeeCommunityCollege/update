<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassAF8EE2C4EE6F436CB3868961C3444D63"><p>​The Takeaway, a public radio news show, is running a series of podcasts called the <a href="http://www.thetakeaway.org/series/communitycollege/">Community College Challenge</a> that explore how community colleges have the power to change the landscape in American higher education. <br /><br />“The series is a good one, but two podcasts that resonated with me were <a href="https://www.wnyc.org/radio/#/ondemand/540884">Want to Increase Student Success? Redesign Community Colleges</a> and <a href="http://www.thetakeaway.org/story/introducing-lake-area-technical-institute/">Community College Challenge: Lake Area Technical Institute</a>,” said Kari Nugent, director of Marketing and Public Relations. “Both are short audio interviews, but to sum it up, students who feel more connected or cared about by faculty and staff do better than students who don’t, and in a time when college students worry about debt and employment after graduation, how can community colleges offer transfer and CTE programs have real value in the real economy. It’s an engaging few minutes. We should all listen.”<br /><br />The Takeaway is a co-production of WNYC Radio and Public Radio International, in collaboration with The New York Times and WGBH Boston.<br /><br /><br /><br /></p></div></div>
