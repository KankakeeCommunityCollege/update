<div><br /><img alt="NEC 1-17-13" src="/SiteCollectionImages/NEC-1-17-13.jpg" />The &quot;NEC photo of the week&quot; shows what is going on at the construction site for the KCC North Extension Center, located at 450 N. Kinzie in Bradley. Each photo was taken facing east.<br /> <br />Photographer's comments: In this picture you can see the finish floor grade and underground plumbing pipes protruding through the floor. In the back you can see the black piping which is the geothermal heating lines coming into the building. Steel erection is anticipated to begin Jan. 24 and should take roughly three weeks to have the framework in place.</div>

<div>This photo was taken on Jan. 17.</div>
