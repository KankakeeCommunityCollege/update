<div><img alt="NEC photo 3-21-2013" src="/SiteCollectionImages/NEC-2013-3-21-compressed.JPG" /> &quot;NEC photo of the week&quot; shows what is going on at the construction site for the KCC North Extension Center, located at 450 N. Kinzie in Bradley. Each photo was taken facing east.<br /> <br />Photographer's comments: Work has resumed on the building after multiple weather related delays. The crews are currently welding roof joists in place and making the final welds and connections on the structure. Weather permitting the second floor decking will soon follow and with the anticipated warmer weather on the horizon the cement work can be done.<br />
