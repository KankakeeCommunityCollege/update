<p> Each week, the &quot;NEC photo of the week&quot; will show what is going on at the construction site for the KCC North Extension Center, located at 450 N. Kinzie in Bradley. Each photo was taken facing east.<br /><br />Photographer's comments: With multiple weather delays last week the crews were able to get back to work this week.  Today (April 25), they finished pouring the second floor slab.  They are almost complete with framing up the outside walls and on the inside a lot of the first floor heating, ventilation and air-conditioning duct work and plumbing have been installed. Soon they will begin framing interior walls, putting on the roofing material and closing in the building.<br />  
<div>This photo was taken on April 25.</div>
