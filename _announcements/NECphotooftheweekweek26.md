<div style="float:left"><span>Each week, the &quot;NEC photo of the week&quot; will show what is going on at the construction site for the KCC North Extension Center, located at 450 N. Kinzie in Bradley. Each photo was taken facing east.<br /> <br />Photographer's comments: Progress continues with the completion of the exterior framing. The first floor interior wall framing is anticipated to be completed Friday, May 10. The week of May 13, the roofers are scheduled to begin and second floor heating, ventillation, air-conditioning and plumbing work will continue. If you drive by the site there is an exterior wall mock-up in place on the south side of the building so you can get an idea of what the exterior of the building will look like. </span>
