<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass555CD0193B6A4AD4AEDE63C28A84AF39"><div>Each week, the &quot;NEC photo of the week&quot; will show what is going on at the construction site for the KCC North Extension Center, located at 450 N. Kinzie in Bradley. This photo was taken facing north.<br /> <br />Photographer's comments: Exterior metal wall panels are being installed on the south, west and east sides of the building. ComEd has removed the old power poles that were in the parking lot and has run new service underground and to the new, larger, transformer on the southeast corner of the building. The glazing contractor has begun installing the windows on the large glass curtain wall. Completion of all windows is anticipated for late next week, approximately Aug. 23.</div>
<div> <br />This photo was taken on Aug. 13.<br /> <br />If you want to access a higher resolution version of the NEC photo of the week, go to the North Extension Center page and view the slideshow of photos. </div>
