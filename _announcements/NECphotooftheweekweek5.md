<div>Each week, the &quot;NEC photo of the week&quot; will show what is going on at the construction site for the KCC North Extension Center, located at 450 N. Kinzie in Bradley. Each photo was taken facing east.<br /></div>
<div>Photographer's comments: A lot of work has been completed. Foundation walls are complete, underground plumbing is complete, the last geothermal well will be done Friday Dec. 14, and the new east parking lot has been brought up to grade and compacted. Next week, week of Dec. 17, the floor slab is anticipated to be poured and completed by the end of the week, weather permitting.</div>
<div><br />This photo was taken on Dec. 14.<br /></div>
