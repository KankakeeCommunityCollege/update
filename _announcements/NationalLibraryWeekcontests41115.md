<div><br>    First, join in on the hunt for a good book! Ten books similar to the one pictured (at right) have been hidden throughout the LRC. Find one and exchange it at the circulation desk for a bag of treats and prizes.</div>
<div><br>    Second, do you think you know how many items are in the LRC's collection? Write your guess on a slip of paper along with your name and email address, and put it in the box at the circulation desk. The person with the closest answer also will win a prize.</font></div>
