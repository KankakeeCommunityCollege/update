<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass476EFA0BD786454394E8338FA0E58C97"><p>​National Radiologic Technology Week®, from Nov. 2-8, is celebrated annually to recognize the vital work of radiologic technologists across the nation.</p>
<p>NRTW was created by the American Society of Radiologic Technologists in 1979. The celebration takes place each year during the week that includes Nov. 8 to commemorate the discovery of the X-ray by Wilhelm Conrad Roentgen on Nov. 8, 1895.</p>
<p>The week-long celebration calls attention to the important role medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals play in patient care and health care safety.</p>
<p>Medical imaging and radiation therapy professionals work with some of the most innovative equipment in the medical field to help identify pathologies, plan and administer treatment and restore patient health. R.T.s specialize in breast imaging, computed tomography, cardiac-interventional procedures, magnetic resonance imaging, nuclear medicine, ultrasound, radiation therapy and general diagnostic radiology.</p>
<p>The theme for this year is: Many Views with One Vision.</p>
<p>KCC offers a two-year associate degree in Radiography, which trains students for careers in radiologic technology. Students who complete the program are eligible to apply for the certification exam administered by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT).</p>
