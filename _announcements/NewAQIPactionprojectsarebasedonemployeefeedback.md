<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassE3D6D16B15574B12920C42DF4BE5ED67><div><font size=2>From: The Office of Institutional Research<br> <br>    In December 2010, Great Expectations Planning Meeting participants identified 20 highest-priority projects for KCC. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    In March 2011, 170 employees completed an online survey to rank the 20 projects. The survey was part of an ongoing strategic planning process related to accreditation. </div>
<div><br>    Following are the priorities, the projects which will relate to them and results from Survey Monkey. </div>
<div><br>    Priority 1 - Preparing Students for Success. Includes a project to align KCC and high school curricula, a project to support underprepared students, and a project to improve student success and goal completion. Picked as first choice by 35.9%; picked as second choice by 21.4%.</div>
<div><br>    Priority 2 - Empowering Employees. Includes a project to improve communication. Picked as first choice by 31.8%; picked as second choice by 17.2%.</div>
<div><br>    Priority 3 - Eradicating confusion about quality improvement terminology, processes, and materials. Includes a project to launch a campus-wide campaign to help employees better understand quality improvement terminology, process and materials for quality improvement. Picked as first choice by 20.4%; picked as second choice by 23.4%.</div>
<div><br>    Based on these results, the Strategy Forum Team (John Avendano, Vicki Gardner, Dennis Sorensen, Julia Waskosky, Vicki Magee, Cathi Hughes, Mendy Corbett and Bruce Myers) are recommending new AQIP Action Projects: &quot;Preparing Students for Success&quot; and &quot;Improve Communication and Launch a Campaign to Help Employees Better Understand Quality Improvement Terminology, Process and Materials.&quot;</div>
<div><br>    Everyone on the Strategy Forum Team thanks employees for taking time to complete the survey. Your opinion is greatly needed an appreciated! Watch Update for more information about plans and timelines for the new Action Projects.</font></div>
