<div><font size="2">KCC’s front courtyard is undergoing renovation with the installation of a new sculpture, plants and landscape materials.  </font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />A new sculpture, Meridian IX, will be installed beginning on Monday, Aug. 15. It was designed and created by artist Ed McCullough. Earlier this summer, the Skylark sculpture was moved in anticipation of the installation of Meridian IX. <br /></div>
<div>According to McCullough, each of the 10 Meridian sculptures requires a place – not just a location – where it can sink its roots and invite people into its open spaces. </div>
<div><br />“Arcs and circles and variants define these open spaces,” McCullough said. “The Meridian sculptures are grounded, but also airborne. They release themselves upward. They stake out boundaries and make connections with everything in and near the sculpture, including you.”</div>
<div><br />McCullough’s design was selected following a competitive process. Its purchase was made possible through funds from the Illinois Capital Develop Board’s Art and Architecture program. </div>
<div><br />Other front courtyard renovations have included removal of bushes and plants earlier this month. <br /></div>
<div>KCC horticulture students are assisting with the planting and maintenance of plants. Last semester, student teams suggested landscape designs for a renovated courtyard as part of their final project for HORT 1154, Landscape Layout &amp; Design. The student design ideas were used as a start point for the final renovation.</div>
