<div> </div>
<div>The Information Technology Services Department is pleased to announce that over the next several weeks, we will be migrating to a new email filter from Barracuda Networks. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This change will allow us to reduce our annual filtering costs by 49 percent while allowing us to provide services to more than three times as many users. The new mail filter will also bring improvements including the ability to send secure “encrypted” emails as well as buttons in Outlook for marking messages as spam. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Over the next several weeks, each employee with an email account will receive a migration date as well as instructions on how to use the new email filter. If you have any questions or would like to volunteer to be one of the first to be migrated, please contact the helpdesk at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@kcc.edu">helpdesk@kcc.edu</a> or 815-802-8900.<br /></div>
