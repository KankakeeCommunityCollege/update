<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassF14D31A135894387A7EFF5F2A469AABF"><p>â€‹Effective Monday, Oct. 30, the Information Technology Services Help Desk will change its hours. </p>
<p>The new hours are <br />Mon.-Thurs.: 7:30 a.m. - 8 p.m.<br />Fri.: 7:30 a.m. - 5 p.m.<br />Sat. &amp; Sun.: Closed</p>
<p>The change is designed to better meet the needs of constituents when demand is greatest. Over the last few years, ITS has seen declining demand on weekdays after 8 p.m. and on weekends. Thus, a reallocation of resources was necessary.</p>
<p>ITS still will make resources available during off-hours by special request.<br />Any questions or concerns can be addressed to Michael OConnor, director of ITS, at <a href="mailto:moconnor@kcc.edu">moconnor@kcc.edu</a> or <span class="baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1" style="white-space:nowrap">815-802-8908<a title="Call: 815-802-8908" href="#" style="overflow:hidden;cursor:hand;border-top:medium none;height:16px;border-right:medium none;width:16px;vertical-align:middle;white-space:nowrap;right:0px;border-bottom:medium none;position:static !important;float:none;left:0px;margin:0px;border-left:medium none;display:inline;top:0px;bottom:0px"></a></span>.<br /></p></div></div>
