<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE803F892409B4F0BBC27DBAB4C64EF66"><p>​<img alt="Appimage1.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Appimage1.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />A new online application has debuted on KCC's website.</p>
<p>Feel free to share this shortcut address: <a href="/apply">www.kcc.edu/apply</a></p>
<p>The new application is &quot;designed to be more user-friendly, more efficient and to create a more welcoming experience for new students,&quot; said David Hermann, director of admissions and registration.</p>
<p>To be more user-friendly, it asks &quot;responsive&quot; questions based on previous answers. For example, applicants who say they are in high school will not be asked what year they graduated from high school. </p>
<p>Upon completion, applicants will see a welcome page from the college president and will be directed to the next step: Orientation. </p>
<p>Congratulations to the collaborators from departments including Information Technology Services, Student Serives/Admissions and Registration and Marketing on successfully completing this project!</p></div></div>
