<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass99EAAC007BC0433FABFDCE9D4A7FDA3D"><p style="color:#00395e">Submitted by David Cagle, director of human resources </p>
<p>It is almost that time again – time for annual performance appraisals of administrators, professional/technical and supportive staff.</p>
<p style="color:#385b83"><strong>The NEW deadlines:</strong></p>
<p>Submit performance appraisals to the Human Resources Office by June 2 for non-supervisory staff (full and part-time) and June 19 for supervisory personnel. </p>
<p style="color:#385b83"><strong>Details/evaluation process</strong></p>
<p>The process includes reflection on your accomplishments, how you met/exceeded last year's goals, and what specific goals/objectives await you in the coming fiscal year.</p>
<p>You should consult your immediate supervisor for his/her deadline which allows time for all levels of supervision to review evaluations before the appropriate Human Resources deadline. Electronic forms are at O:\Share\KCC\Human Resources\HR Forms\Evaluation Forms. </p>
<p>As part of this process, if the position description is not accurate, your supervisor should make proposed revisions and submit them to Human Resources with the evaluation. A &quot;Specific responsibilities&quot; section should also be included.</p>
<p>The process will be as follows: </p>
<ol><li>Complete a self-evaluation.</li>
<li>Submit it as a Word document to your immediate supervisor. Schedule a meeting with him/her to discuss performance, review the completed tasks, establish new goals through March 2018, and complete the final evaluation. Note: Input/support from department directors should be solicited prior to this meeting.</li>
<li>Sign the completed evaluation, get your immediate supervisor's signature, plus the appropriate department director's. Keep a copy (or save it electronically). Your supervisor should do the same (for use during next year's evaluation process).</li>
<li>Deliver a paper copy to Human Resources by the appropriate due date.</li></ol>
<p>Please contact <a href="mailto:dcagle@kcc.edu">David Cagle</a> at 815-802-8128 if you have any questions regarding this process.</p></div></div>
