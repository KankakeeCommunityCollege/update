<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassB9FB7A6F34814656B91ECA25F2810767"><p>Representatives from instructional areas, Student Services and the Marketing Department have been working to implement a new electronic catalog for 2016-17.</p>
<p>Several improvements are expected with the new format. They include:</p>
<ul><li>More accuracy and streamlined information.</li>
<li>Integration with other technologies such as the academic curriculum process and Ellucian’s Collegue.• Consistent, user-friendly navigation, and a search function capable of returning results from the entire catalog, specific courses or programs.</li>
<li>The ability to print a page without unnecessary elements.</li>
<li>More efficient catalog development process</li>
<li>Security using industry standard/best practices for backups, disaster recovery, secure data center, networks, firewall, protocols and encryption. </li>
<li>Web analysis compatibility to provide website statistics and reports.</li>
<li>The dawn of a new catalog era also means some content which used to be both in the printed catalog and on www.kcc.edu will now be housed in one location and linked to the other. </li></ul>
<p>The 2016-17 catalog is effective for the Fall 2016 semester. It will go live on/before March 15. Once it is complete, a link will be shared. There still will be printed catalogs, which should arrive at KCC on/before April 12.</p>
<p>Anyone with comments or questions about the project is invited to contact <a href="mailto:eskelly@kcc.edu">Ellen Skelly </a>of the Marketing Department.</p></div></div>
