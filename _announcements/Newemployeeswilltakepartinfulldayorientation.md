<div> </div>
<div>Beginning in February, new full-time employees will take part in a full-day KCC orientation. <br /></div>
<div>The orientation will include paperwork required of new employees, information on policies and benefits, mission, core values, strategic goals, vision, customer service, safety &amp; security, and overviews of areas of the college. There also will be a tour of KCC during the day. The orientation day will include time for the new employee to meet with his/her supervisor and/or mentor.</div>
<div><br />The orientation is being offered in response to results from the annual Noel Levitz Employee Satisfaction Survey. On the survey, employees gave satisfaction rating of 3.08 to the statement “Employees receive a thorough orientation to their new positions” and a satisfaction rating of 3.12 to “The institution consistently follows clear processes for orienting and training new employees.” A 5.0 is the highest possible satisfaction rating.</div>
<div><br />Because these two statements on the survey were ranked as two of the four lowest in terms of employee satisfaction, the Employee Morale Committee has been working on developing this program for the past several months. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We believe this should not only help new employees feel more comfortable and knowledgeable in their new roles with the college, it should help increase employee morale as well.</div>
<div><br />KCC's president, Dr. Avendano, expressed his thanks and appreciation to the Employee Morale Committee for their efforts in getting this program up and running.</div>
