<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass3166C493FA1D4E84B2EAAE19D976F7DD"><div>After a national search, KCC has selected Julian Springer as its new head men’s basketball coach.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Most recently, Springer was head men’s basketball coach and sports coordinator at Rock Valley College in Rockford. Last season, his second as head coach, the Golden Eagles recorded its first winning record (20-11) after 10 straight losing seasons. The team also completed one of its best conference turnarounds in school history, going from 4-10 in his first season to 9-5 in 2011-12.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“KCC has a tremendous amount of basketball tradition and community support,” said Springer. “After visiting the campus for my interview, I knew that I wanted to join the KCC family. I look forward to being a part of the Kankakee community and I’m ready to get started.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Before becoming head coach in 2010 at Rock Valley, Springer was an assistant for NCAA Division I Jackson State University in Jackson, Miss., and an assistant at NCAA Division III Alma College in Alma, Mich. He also directed and coached basketball for the Chicago Park District Chicago City League Sports program for two summers. During that time, more than 20 student-athletes from the league earned Division I scholarships.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Julian Springer has a history of success working with student-athletes,” said Ted Petersen, KCC athletic director. “Though it is important and beneficial that he has coaching experience, Springer will have his biggest impact as a motivator and educator. His talent as a coach will be complemented nicely by his history of success with students.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At Rock Valley College, Springer's non-coaching responsibilities included athlete eligibility, academic progress reports, and campus and community outreach.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Springer has a bachelor’s degree from Southern Illinois University in Carbondale; a master’s degree in health, physical education and recreation from Jackson State University; and a master’s degree in athletic administration from Central Michigan University in Mount Pleasant, Mich.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A Chicago native, Springer is a graduate of St. Ignatius High School, where he played basketball and made the “Sweet 16” during the 2000 Illinois High School Association basketball tournament. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>He is a member of the National Association of Basketball Coaches, Black Coaches Association, and the National Intramural and Recreational Sports Association. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Springer is the seventh head men’s basketball coach in KCC’s history. His job title will be coordinator of athletic academic success program and head men’s basketball coach. </div>
<div> <br />Springer replaces Joseph Lightfoot, whose contract ended on June 30. Lightfoot was a KCC assistant for 12 seasons and head coach for six seasons.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC will open its 2012-13 season on Nov. 3 with a home game against Future Academy Prep. Cavaliers home games are played in the George H. Ryan Gymnasium at KCC.<br /> <br />
