<div> </div>
<div>Those who have entered or exited the building through the Prairie entrance throughout the spring have witnessed the culmination of much hard work and dedication of several faculty members and their students. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A long overdue thank you goes out to John Willard, Adam Woodruff, Curt Ralston, Anthony Cooper and their students in the Highway Construction Careers Training Program who have braved weather, schedules, and set-backs to create the Prairie Patio--a place for students and staff to gather, collaborate and learn. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Prairie Patio came to life a couple of weeks ago. The patio was not quite finished when Physical Plant Department personnel brought in the new picnic table. The table had not been there 24 hours when a group of students gathered to inaugurate it (again, a new place to gather, collaborate, and learn)!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A special shout-out goes to these faculty members and students.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Not only is the patio already making the space more enjoyable and usable by students, the project of tuck-pointing (essentially rebuilding of the retaining walls) at the entrance of the Prairie Lot has also served to be a great project for this group. One of the greatest moments I had was standing from afar observing John and Adam collaborate on the plan for the retaining walls.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This was just one of the examples of how these instructors put much time and effort into the planning of the learning experiences for their students, only to allow the students to work through the planning themselves. Each of these faculty members leads by example and are right in there doing the work among the students.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On behalf of the many students (and faculty/staff) who are already enjoying the Prairie Patio, thank you! We already see a need for another table. It is a special little spot (and the amazing fragrance of the lilacs are perfect right now). Spread the word!</div>
