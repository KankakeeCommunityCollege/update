<div><br />The KCC Foundation is using a new process for students to accept their scholarships for the fall semester. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Letters have been sent to the 124 students who were selected for scholarships asking them to accept or deny the award(s). Those who accept the award will be asked to attend a mandatory scholarship orientation on July 10. Morning and afternoon sessions will be offered.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the orientation students will: </div>
<div><br />• Write thank you letters. The letters will be forwarded to donors along with the student’s photo.<br />• Gain an understanding of the responsibilities of being a scholarship recipient. The responsibilities include meeting the criteria of their scholarship in both semesters that it is awarded, attending the Scholarship Recognition Dinner on Oct. 22, and being advocates for KCC Foundation scholarships.<br />• Learn about the importance of philanthropy and how it affects our institution.<br />• Have their photo taken and sign a release that allows use of it.</div>
