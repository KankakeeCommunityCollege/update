<div>A new sculpture will be installed at KCC by the artist on July 14 and 15.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;I am so excited to have this important piece of sculpture, <em>Chicago Nike</em>, on our campus!&quot; said Jean Janssen, curator of KCC’s permanent art collection. It will be located on the north lawn, north of the playground.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;<em>Chicago Nike</em> was fabricated in 1998 for the Pier Walk exhibition at Navy Pier,&quot; said the artist, Barry Tinsley. &quot;From that exhibition it went to a sculpture park in St. Paul, Minn. for four years, then, I moved it to Sheboygan, Wis. where it has since resided.</div>
<div><br />&quot;The sculpture is fabricated from 2 inch plate steel and granite. The steel was purchased from Belson Steel in Bourbonnais and the granite came from Cold Spring Granite company in Cold Spring, Minn.</div>
<div><br />&quot;The title <em>Chicago Nike</em> was chosen due to the strong gestural movement of the sculpture reflecting the dynamic and vitality of the city and the historically  famous Greek sculpture, <em>Nike of Samothrace</em>.&quot;</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The sculpture was acquired with money from the KCC Foundation Brandenburg Campus Beautification fund.<br /></div>
<div>In related news, The<em> Skylark</em> sculpture, which has long been part of KCC's collection, will be re-installed before the beginning of fall classes. It will be in a grass area west of College Drive and south of the greenhouse.</div>
