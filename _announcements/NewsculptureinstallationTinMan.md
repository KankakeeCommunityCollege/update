<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass4D1F644D5FC64D3685B33BE49803FE65"><p>A new sculpture has been installed at KCC.</p>
<p><em>Tin Man</em>, by Andrew Arvanetes, a 1981 KCC graduate, was installed north of the Arts and Sciences Building on Friday, Sept. 26.</p>
<p>At KCC, Arvanetes studied art history, drawing and design under Janet Heineke. “My last semester there I took a 3-D design and sculpture classes from Ed McCullough who was then a visiting artist,” Arvanetes said. “Ed recommended that I continue my studies with Bruce White at Northern Illinois University, where I received my BFA and MFA.”</p>
<p>On the website <a href="http://sarasotaseasonofsculpture.org/portfolio/tin-man/">Season of Sculpture</a>, Arvanetes says “This sculpture, <em>Tin Man</em> is the first piece in a planned series loosely identified as ‘robots.’ This new series is related to a recent group of ‘figurative’ low reliefs that dealt humorously with the everyday activities of our sometimes mundane lives. The imagery is connected to memories of some of my favorite cartoon characters common in Japanese animation of the 1960s.”</p>
<p>The KCC Foundation acquired <em>Tin Man</em> through the Campus Beautification Fund/Brandenburg Fund. </p>
<p>&quot;When KCC purchases an art work, we follow the guidelines established by the original art committee recommendation that the artist is from Illinois,&quot; said Jean Janssen, KCC's art curator. &quot;Andrew is a KCC alumni and grew up in this community. <em>Tin Man</em> is whimsical and facilitates lively interaction with its viewers and reminds us of moving forward toward the future, like students do at KCC. It fits right in.</p>
<p>&quot;This sculpture, along with other works on campus, continues  to broaden audience engagement by providing a variety of ways for the KCC community and the visiting public to learn more about sculpture as an art form and its relevance to the beauty, creativity, and imagination of expression.&quot;<br /><br /></p>
