<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass7C7941149FC348FBA8EBE3D0A8E2F393">
<div>This is the first installment in a series of articles on results from the 2013 Noel-Levitz Employee Satisfaction survey, which was administered in February 2013.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Following is a general summary of employees’ satisfaction with their employment at KCC. All ratings are on a scale of 1-5 with 5 being &quot;very satisfied.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Highlights comparing 2012 to 2013:<br />• 40 (65%) of the survey’s 62 questions showed improvement.<br />• 18 questions (29%) showed a slight decrease in satisfaction, and four (6%) remained the same.<br />• The number of employees completing the survey decreased by 6.3% from 204 to 191.<br />• As in 2012, none of the 62 questions had an employee satisfaction level less than 3.0. </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>The Employee Morale Committee reviews all results of the Employee Satisfaction Survey, but focuses attention on trends in employee satisfaction related to two main questions: </div>
<div><br />1. How satisfied are employees with their employment so far? From 2012 to 2013, the satisfaction rating increased from 4.02 to 4.08.</div>
<div><br />2. How satisfied are employees with the way the college promotes positive employee morale? From 2012 to 2013, the satisfaction rating increased from 3.29 to 3.30.</div>
<div><br />The five statements with the highest employee satisfaction ratings were: <br />• I am proud to work at this institution (4.27)<br />• The type of work I do on most days is personally rewarding (4.24)<br />• Rate your overall satisfaction with your employment here so far (4.08)<br />• The work I do is valuable to the institution (4.07)<br />• My job makes good use of my skills and abilities (4.03)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The five statements with the lowest employee satisfaction ratings were:<br />• There are effective lines of communication between departments (3.01)<br />• Employees receive a thorough orientation to their new positions (3.15)<br />• The institution consistently follows clear processes for orienting and training new employees (3.16)<br />• I have adequate opportunities for advancement (3.20)<br />• The institution has written procedures that clearly define who is responsible for each operation and service (3.22)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In future <em>Updates</em>, the Employee Morale Committee will release: a comparison of 2013 results with other two-year schools; a comparison of results by administrator, faculty, and support staff; and employees’ responses to the survey’s open ended questions.</div>
