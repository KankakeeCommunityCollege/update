<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass5FF37B3A84384E2A88AA947781657E62><div>    <font size=2> Until all college workstations are converted to Microsoft Exchange (Outlook), there will be some differences for those using the two different platforms - Outlook and GroupWise. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    For example, GroupWise users are not able to busy search users who have been migrated to Outlook. But, after conversion, Outlook users can perform a busy search on all users, whether they are on Outlook or GroupWise. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    Also related to calendars, after conversion, users of Outlook are able to access the calendar (after permission has been granted by the user) for others who are on Outlook. But, to see GroupWise calendars for which they previously had proxy rights, they should use the GroupWise client.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    Because the biggest change occurs as a computer user converts from GroupWise to Outlook, a detailed e-mail is sent to everyone who signs up for Outlook training before their instruction session. Some of the main topics are when Outlook will be installed, when to start using Outlook, the process of mail migration, what will happen with mail archives. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    For more information on the conversion, please contact the Information Technology Services Help Desk at 815-802-8900.</font></div>
