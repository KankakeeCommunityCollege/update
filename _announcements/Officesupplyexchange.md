<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassDFFBAC15829E4C5DAE933F0B31592AB0"><p>​Do you have extra file folders that are new or still usable? How about too many paper clips, staples or other new or gently used office supplies?<br /><br />On Tuesday March 8 from 9 a.m. - noon there will be an “Office Supply Exchange” in Room L279.<br /><br /><span style="color:blue">How it works:</span><br />Please bring any gently used or excess office supplies to L279 between 8-9 a.m. on Tuesday, March 8.<br /><br />Then beginning at 9 a.m. visit Room L279 to look over the collection and take whatever you can use. The idea is a sort of office supplies “garage sale.”<br /><br /><span style="color:blue">Stipulations</span><br />The items are to be used for KCC business only and whoever takes the items must plan to actually use them!<br /><br />Whatever remains after noon will be recycled or otherwise disposed. (Some items may be offered to students, such as folders or binders.) So, don’t wait, start collecting items today.<br /><br />Questions can be directed to Liz Becvar 815-802-8253 or by <a href="mailto:ebecvar@kcc.edu">email</a>.<br /></p></div></div>
