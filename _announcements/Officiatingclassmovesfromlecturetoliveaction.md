<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass2B7F40BDF21E4B02A36CCA8C54BB8650><div>On the morning of Nov. 20, the Officiating Men's Basketball class, PHED 1811, applied what they learned in the classroom during a live game situation. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The students paired up and officiated two youth basketball games at the Kankakee Area YMCA. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;The 9, 10 and 11 year-olds provided quite an experience for the class,&quot; said instructor Eddie Anderson Jr. &quot;The students were very surprised at the speed of the game and the constant movement and activity from one end of the court to the other.&quot;</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Eddie wanted the students to have real game experience.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;PowerPoint presentations, guest speakers, rules knowledge, and lecture only capture so much,&quot; he said. &quot;I believe you gain a greater appreciation and understanding for officiating any sport when you have an opportunity to play the part.&quot; </div>
<div> </div>
<div>During the game, students were shadowed and mentored by several Illinois High School Association officials who ran side-by-side with the students and provided immediate feedback. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;I thought it was cool that licensed officials were there to work with us during the game,&quot; said Jesse Green. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;They (officials) were constantly talking to us and pointing things out even when we were on the sideline watching the other guys,&quot; said Brandon Whybrew. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>After the games, the officials answered questions and provided additional feedback to the class. Eddie said the activity went very well. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;Hopefully, the mentoring coupled with the on-court experience enhanced the previous in-class instruction and will make the remaining class time more meaningful,&quot; he said.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Eddie also expressed his thanks to Dennis Sorensen, the KCC Athletic Department, the Kankakee Area YMCA and the IHSA officials for making this endeavor a success. <br></div></div></div>
