<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass9BC7109ABC7F4F889DE446BB93BE50F3"><div><font size="2">The Kankakee Community College Foundation’s new online scholarship application makes it easier for students to apply.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />The application is at </font><a href="/scholarships"><font size="2">www.kcc.edu/scholarships</font></a><font size="2">. The deadline to apply for 2013-14 KCC Foundation scholarships is Friday, April 19, 2013.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"> <br />For the online application, students submit their essays online and list individuals who can provide letters of recommendation. A feature of the program is that data from students’ applications will automatically match them to available scholarships. A search mechanism also allows applicants to review what is available.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />The KCC Foundation will offer 204 scholarships worth more than $200,000 for the 2013-14 academic year.<br />“Quite often, the ability to afford college goes hand in hand with the ability to attend college,” said Rebecca Wilder, coordinator of scholarships and annual giving for the KCC Foundation. “Though KCC has used online applications in the past, this software streamlines the selection process for that students can know sooner if they will receive an award, allowing them to know more about their financial resources when planning for college.”</div>
