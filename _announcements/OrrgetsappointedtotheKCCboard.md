<div><br />He is a graduate of Joliet Junior College and has both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in agronomy from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. </div>
<div><br />“I am interested in being involved with higher education in this area and in representing the west end of the county on the KCC board,” Orr said. “I know a lot of kids who have gone to KCC and have had a good experience.”</div>
<div><br />Orr and his wife, Sherri, have four children. Three of them have taken KCC courses. His other daughter is in grade school.</div>
<div><br />In addition to the KCC board, Orr is on the board of elders at Trinity Lutheran Church in Herscher. He also is a former member of the Illinois Certified Crop Advisor Board.</div>
