The program was re-introduced at KCC in Fall 2009 after being absent from the program offerings for several years.</div>
<div><br>    It is a competitive entry program, with a maximum of 20 students entering it each fall. </div>
<div><br>    The five-semester program integrates professional standards, theory and clinical education in a variety of physical therapy settings. Students progress through the program as a cohort group. </div>
<div><br>    Physical Therapist Assistant graduates are prepared for employment as entry-level physical therapist assistants who work under the direction and supervision of a physical therapist. Employment settings for physical therapist assistants include hospitals, outpatient clinics, rehabilitation centers, nursing homes, home health, hospice facilities, school districts, and research centers.  <br> </font></div></div></div>
