<p>Our next pay date is Friday, Nov. 25. For those receiving direct deposits, your pay should be deposited that day, unless your financial institution is closed due to holiday.</p>
<p>Direct deposit employees can check with their deposit institution to see if it will be open Friday. If it is open, no further action is needed. If it is closed and you want a paper check, contact <a href="mailto:jclark@kcc.edu">Jane Clark</a> in the Human Resources Office by 4:30 p.m. on Monday, Nov 21. She will remove the direct deposit for this pay period and you will be issued a paper check.</p>
<p>All those receiving a paper pay check can pick them up on Wednesday, Nov. 23 from 2-3 p.m. The check will be dated Nov. 25.  Checks not picked up by 3 p.m. will be mailed on Nov. 23.  Any questions, please contact Jane at 815-802-8146.</p></div></div>
