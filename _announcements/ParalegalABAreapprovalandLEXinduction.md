<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass86C8500808A14538B277D96788143F60">
<div><font size="2">The American Bar Association has re-approved the Kankakee Community College Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program for seven years.<br /></font></div>
<div><font size="2">The re-approval was granted in August, and the new approval period is until August 2019.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The program re-approval coincides with the beginning of the 10th year KCC has offered Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies courses. Program graduates and students celebrated the 10 year milestone on Aug. 11 with a dinner. The event also raised $400 for the Patsy A. Lower/LEX Legal Professional Scholarship in memory of Roger Elliott, president of the Kankakee County Bar Association.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“ABA approval is a multi-phase process which involves a comprehensive self-study and application,” said Kris Condon, coordinator of the KCC Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program. “The ABA examines all facets of the program, from the curriculum and faculty to student services and physical plant. Once the written report with exhibits is reviewed by ABA staff for accuracy, a two-day site team visit is scheduled.”</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The re-approval site team, a paralegal program director from an ABA-approved program and a practicing paralegal, met with KCC President John Avendano, senior administrative staff, alumni, students, and members of the legal community. Upon completion of the site visit and the recommendation for re-approval, the application was voted on by the American Bar Association House of Delegates at its meeting in Chicago, held Aug. 2-7.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Two degrees are offered through KCC’s Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program, a two-year associate degree program for those who plan to immediately enter the workforce or to transfer into a four-year bachelor’s degree program and a one-year advanced certificate for those already holding a bachelor’s degree.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">To date, there are 36 graduates of the KCC associate degree program and 13 graduates of the advanced certificate.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">KCC has partnership agreements for paralegal graduates with Illinois State University in Normal, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, St. Mary-of-the-Woods in Indiana and Calumet College of St. Joseph in Indiana.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2"><font color="#0000ff">LEX induction<br /></font>Lambda Epsilon Chi—the national honor society in Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies has added a new honorary member from Kankakee Community College.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Kankakee attorney Jason Cieslik, formerly an assistant state’s attorney and formerly a partner in the law firm of Barmann, Bohlen, Jacobi &amp; Cieslik, P.C., was inducted into Lambda Epsilon Chi for his service to the program as an adjunct faculty member.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Lambda Epsilon Chi Honor Society is a nationally-based honor society in paralegal studies that is administered by the American Association for Paralegal Education. There are only nine other Lambda Epsilon Chi chapters in Illinois.<br /></font></div>
<div><font size="2">“The Lambda Epsilon Chi membership status pertains only to students who exemplify exceptional performance and to faculty who have served our program and its participants,” said Kris Condon, the program’s coordinator. “Jason exemplifies the ethics, both personal and professional, that we expect of our students every day. LEX membership is an honor conferred upon the best and the brightest our program has to offer. Jason has consistently done his part to guarantee that our students stay accountable to that standard.” </font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Among requirements for membership in the society, each student member must have completed at least two-thirds of the program requirements, have an overall grade point average of 3.5 or higher at KCC, as well as a grade point average of 3.75 or higher in paralegal/legal assistant studies classes. In addition, applicants must submit a legal writing sample and participate in a personal interview and a timed writing activity, all of which are reviewed by the LEX Selection Subcommittee.</font></div>
