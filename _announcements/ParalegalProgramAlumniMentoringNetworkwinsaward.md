<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass3250EE618B2B4173BDE9FA9CEDF06862"><div><br />The KCC Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program has received an honorable mention award for its Paralegal Program Alumni Mentoring Network. </div>
<div><br />The Paralegal Program Alumni Mentoring Network originated in 2007 at the suggestion of two alumni of the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies Program. It provides students in their first-semester of the program with mentors who can provide guidance, be role models, help with studying and help with test‐taking strategies. The alumni mentors correspond with their assigned students by email or in person.</div>
<div><br />“The introductory course has intensive writing demands because of the nature of the work,” said Kris Condon, coordinator of the Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program. “In addition, the course must be completed with a minimum grade of ‘B’ to persist in the program.  We found that the persistence rate of our students climbed 21% during the first semester of alumni intervention in the classroom. Data reflects that introductory students who maintain a relationship with their alumni mentor overall have higher test scores and higher course success rates.”</div>
<div><br />The award was announced on April 10, 2013 at the 24th Annual Exemplary Initiatives Competition during the International Conference on College Teaching and Learning. The National Council of Instructional Administrators selected KCC’s program in the category of Student Access, Persistence, and Completion. The NCIA is an affiliated council of the American Association of Community Colleges.<br /></div>
