<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass5EEA6903FFB2425D95BD4CD6D23B1AB5"><p>KCC’s new portal will be available to the KCC community by the end of June.</p>
<p>Over the next several weeks, <em>Update</em> will share details of different aspects of the project, including the usual “where the project is” and “where the project will be” information.</p>
<p>This week is about the project scope, plus a few definitions.</p>
<p>KCC’s portal will be a web-enabled platform that provides constituents with a unique, personalized experience centered around communication, application, and document delivery.</p>
<p>Some highlights of what the portal will do:</p>
<ul><li>Act as a unified communication/collaboration platform.</li>
<li>Deliver self-service applications, e.g. student planning.</li>
<li>Allow a “Single sign-on” to a number of applications. </li>
<li>Integrate with the Colleague (Datatel) Student Information System, for targeted content and communication.</li>
<li>Integrate with KCC network drives (O:\Share) for document management.</li>
<li>Adapt to any size screen, including mobile devices.</li></ul>
<p>The following image is an early (early!) screenshot of one of our portal pages. Expect that when the portal is unveiled, it will not look just like this. This picture just shows some elements that will come together on the page. The sample is a stitched-together screenshot of the top and bottom of the page. </p>
<p><img alt="portal-preview-stitched-image-resized.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/portal-preview-stitched-image-resized.jpg" style="margin:5px" /><br /><br /><br />Most applications shown on the portal will be accessible with one click. That’s the single sign-on feature.</p>
<p>As the portal becomes part of the college fabric, it might be helpful to know a few related definitions.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Intranet: </strong>A computer network that uses Internet technology to share information and/or computing services within an organization. It may host multiple, private websites (web portal) and constitute an important component for communication and collaboration.</li>
<li><strong>Web Portal:</strong> A specially designed web page, which brings information together from diverse sources in a uniform way. Each information source will usually have a distinct area on the page for displaying information, which can typically be modified by the user.</li>
<li><strong>Single Sign-on:</strong> A user is able to login once and have access to all their resources. Pre-portal, KCC does not have single sign-on, we have “single password.” Though the portal is a single sign-on environment, some resources will not initially be part of single sign-on, due to compatibility issues that are still being worked on.</li></ul>
<p>Anyone with questions about the portal project is invited to contact <a href="mailto:moconnor@kcc.edu">Michael O’Connor</a> or <a href="mailto:knugent@kcc.edu">Kari Nugent</a>, who are leading the implementation team.​</p>
<p>Future weeks will share the implementation timeline, details of the different teams working on portal development, training, and continuing development. </p></div></div>
