<div>
<div>The Students for Animals Club will host Pet Awareness Week Tuesday, April 24 through Thursday, April 26, from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Club members will be in the College Center on Tuesday and Thursday; they will be in outside the Iroquois Room on Wednesday.     </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Members of the club will share information and encourage adopting pets. Adoption instead of buying from pet stores and breeders helps curb the pet overpopulation problem and high euthanasia rates of perfectly healthy animals, said Linsey Cuti, club advisor.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The club also will offer information on low cost spay neuter programs and other pet wellness information. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>There will be dog/cat suckers for sale to raise money for the club. </div></div></div></div>
