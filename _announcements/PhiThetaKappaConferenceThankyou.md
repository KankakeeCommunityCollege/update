<p>Sincere thanks to all who contributed to the success of the Illinois Region’s Phi Theta Kappa Honors Institute &amp; Leadership Conference that was held at KCC Oct. 9-12. It is said that it takes a village to raise a child; well, it took a whole college to host a statewide conference for 160 people!<br /><br />The featured speakers, Ted Peterson, Dr. John Avendano, Kris Condon and Tim Wilhelm did an outstanding job and made a very positive impact on all attendees. Arena Food Services staff members Shaun, Carrie and Mike went out of their way to feed and serve us well. Security staff—Eric, Dan and others—took great care of us and unlocked doors many times so we could get where we needed to go. Custodial services—Stella Mausehund and everyone on staff—got us set up and kept everything clean throughout the weekend.  Information Technology Services staff helped with technical issues; thank you. Special thanks to Rich Soderquist and George Mateja for providing the fire pit and wood; the students greatly enjoyed the campfire and making s’mores. Thanks to Aindrea Hogan in the Foundation for her assistance and to the front desk staff—Steve Makepeace and Judy Spence—for the numerous ways they offered aid throughout the conference. Thank you to the marketing and media staff members Stephen Dockemeyer, Ellen Skelly, Liz Becvar and others for support with printing and sound, and for the balloons. Thank you to the Physical Education Department for the donation of sodas and water, for setting up the volleyball nets and letting us use the gym for the Saturday night activity. Thank you to Laura Gardner for her support and assistance with numerous aspects of the event. Thank you to the Continuing Education &amp; Career Services and the Health Careers departments for their assistance and for the use of their classrooms. Thank you to Cyndy Riordan for her assistance with a wide variety of tasks related to the conference.</p>
<p>Special thanks to KCC’s administration, Dr. Avendano, Dr. Michael Boyd and Julia Waskosky for their support and assistance. Thank you to the KCC Alpha Delta Eta chapter members and officers who worked hard throughout the conference and were always there, taking care of whatever needed to be done. Thanks too, to everyone who offered help and encouragement along the way. If we have unintentionally failed to mention anyone, please know that we recognized your contributions and they were greatly appreciated.<br /><br /></p>
