<div>For the 10th time, the Kankakee Community College chapter of Phi Theta Kappa has received the Five Star Award, the highest level of chapter development achievement. </div>
<div><br />The KCC chapter, Alpha Delta Eta, was recognized at the Illinois Regional Convention, held June 1-3 in Palatine, for its accomplishments during the 2011-12 academic year.</div>
<div><br /> Activities and programs of the chapter which led to the five-star status included conducting research and hosting a public forum, “What the Internet is Doing to Our Brains”; sponsoring a signature drive which garnered nearly 800 names of students committed to completing a college credential; and participating in service projects such as the city of Kankakee clean-up and American Cancer Society fundraising.</div>
<div><br /> A chapter officer and adviser also received awards for their leadership.</div>
<div><br />Joshua Beneze of Chebanse received the Hall of Honor Outstanding Officer Award for achievements during his term as co-president during 2011-12. Beneze also was elected to represent 13 Illinois community colleges as vice president for the state’s central district during the 2012-13 academic year.<br />Susan LaMore, co-adviser for the chapter, received the Horizon Award and the Hall of Honor Advisor Award for outstanding service to the Alpha Delta Eta chapter.<br />KCC’s chapter of Phi Theta Kappa currently has 150 members.</div>
<div><br /> In addition to Beneze, 2011-12 chapter officers were Karl Roth of Martinton, co-president; Christopher Both of Watseka, vice president of scholarship; Kelly Roth of Martinton, vice president of service; and Megan Wauthier of Clifton, recording secretary. Phi Theta Kappa advisers are LaMore and Frances Hebert.<br /></div>
<div> Phi Theta Kappa is an international academic honor society for community college students. To be eligible for membership, students must have a 3.5 grade point average or better on a 4.0 scale. KCC holds induction ceremonies for eligible students each fall and spring semester.</div>
<div><br />Phi Theta Kappa has recognized academic excellence in the two-year college since 1918. It is the largest honor society in American higher education with more than 1.5 million members.
