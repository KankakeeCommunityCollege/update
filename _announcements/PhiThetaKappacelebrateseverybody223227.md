<p>The events are to inform the students and staff of the dangers of eating disorders. &quot;In the United States, 20 million women and 10 million men suffer from a clinically significant eating disorder at some time in their life&quot; according to <a href="http://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/">www.nationaleatingdisorders.org</a>.</p>
<p>Phi Theta Kappa will offer a banner to sign pledging “Celebrate Every Body.” An information table also will have materials including a card with a QR code which links to visit a website and privately do a personal risk assessment. Brochures about eating disorders might be available as well.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Feb. 25, free wristbands with the slogan &quot;Celebrate Every Body&quot; will be distributed from 9 a.m. - 2 p.m. int he College Center. On the other days, a limited supply of wristbands will be on the information table.</p>
<p>Phi Theta Kappa has recognized academic excellence in the two-year college since 1918. It is the largest honor society in American higher education, with more than 1.5 million members. The society offers opportunities for scholarships, intellectual enrichment, and personal development through programs based on the society’s hallmarks of scholarship, leadership, service, and fellowship. </p>
