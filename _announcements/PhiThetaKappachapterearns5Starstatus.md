<div>For the eighth time, the Kankakee Community College chapter of the Phi Theta Kappa international honor society has achieved five-star status, recognizing the highest level of activity within the organization.</div>
<div><br>To earn recognition, the chapter participated in a number of fundraising and philanthropic activities during the 2010-11 school year. </div>
<div><br>One activity was to conduct a coat and clothing drive. More than 35 bags of clothing were donated to the local Salvation Army. A used book drive was held as well. The book drive partner, Better World Books, recognized KCC as one of only 10 colleges in the country which attained the Diamond tier level of participation. Chapter members also tutored students studying for the GED high school equivalency test, raised funds for the American Cancer Society by selling carnations on Valentine’s Day, and continued an ongoing collection of aluminum pull tabs to donate to Chicago’s Ronald McDonald House.</div>
<div><br>KCC’s chapter of Phi Theta Kappa has 120 members.<br>Chapter officers for 2010-11 were Michael Nemeth of Bradley, president; Stephen Hoctor of Momence, vice president of scholarship; Marcos Barajas of Momence, vice president of service; and Rebecca Hoffman of Peotone, vice president of fellowship.</div>
<div><br>Phi Theta Kappa advisers for 2010-11 were Susan LaMore, Frances Hebert, Meredith Purcell and Scott Kistler.</div>
