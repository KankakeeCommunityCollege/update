<div><br />For the 11th time, the Alpha Delta Eta chapter achieved a Five Star Award, an international honor that recognizes the highest level of activity within the organization.</div>
<div><br />Some activities of the chapter which led to the five-star status included joining the Community College Completion Corps campaign to encourage students to finish a credential or a degree, conducting research on the invasive emerald ash borer and sharing results with the community on the KCC website (both in English and in Spanish), attending and presenting educational forums at two PTK Illinois Region conventions, attending the PTK International Convention and conducting membership campaigns during the fall and spring semesters.</div>

The officers were Caleb Mau, president; Kyle Lewis, vice president; Aimee Clayton, recording secretary; Cheyenne Caron, public relations secretary; Joshua Beneze, Honors in Action chair; Ashley Boykin, College Project chair; and Blaise Garstkiewicz, membership chair. <br />Beneze also received an Illinois Region Leader of Distinction Award for outstanding leadership of the region’s central district, where he served as its vice president.</div>
<div><br />Susan LaMore, an advisor for the KCC chapter, received an All-Illinois Advisor Team award for leadership accomplishments.</div>
<div><br />The chapter also held a fundraising activity which allowed them to make a contribution to the American Cancer Society and collected gently used sports equipment for a donation to the Illinois Special Olympics.</div>
<div><br />Along with Susan, Frances Hebert also serves as a KCC Phi Theta Kappa advisor.</div>
<div><br />Phi Theta Kappa is an international academic honor society for community college students. To be eligible to join Phi Theta Kappa, students must have a 3.5 grade point average or better on a 4.0 scale.</div>
