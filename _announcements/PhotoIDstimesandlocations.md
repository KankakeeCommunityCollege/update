<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassA194DFCF4D604052B6F9B09D73573B3D><div>Full- and part-time employees, as well as all students, are required to have a KCC photo ID card. </div>
<div><br>Students need to have their IDs validated every semester. Employee IDs do not need to be validated.</div>
<div><br>Students must bring their registration statement and a state-issued photo ID. Employees also need a state-issued photo ID to conduct all actions related to KCC IDs.</div>
<div><br>As a standard procedure, photo ID processing will be near the Transfer Center in Student Services the final week of registration and Monday and Tuesday the first week of classes. The rest of the time, the ID system will be in the Learning Resource Center and available during regular LRC hours.</div>
<div><br>The KCC photo ID card is given immediately after the photo is taken. </div>
<div><br>Students who already have IDs can have them validated at the location where photo IDs are being processed.</div>
<div><br>Anyone with questions regarding the policies and procedures related to photo IDs should contact Joyce Cochran at 815-802-8582.<br></div></div></div>
