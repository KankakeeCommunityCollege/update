<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC4F51FD8103E4AD9994A52FAC1DA073F"><p>​In preparation for the KCC 50th Anniversary celebrations, photos are needed to show life at the college through the years.</p>
<p>Anyone with pictures from KCC events or scenery, is invited to share them. Digital and print photos will be welcome. Please provide details such as year and date taken, event info, location, and people's names. </p>
<p>To share, please send photos to Elizabeth Becvar in the Marketing Department or email <a href="mailto:ebecvar@kcc.edu">ebecvar@kcc.edu</a>. If the photos don't fit in an email, contact Liz or <a href="mailto:eskelly@kcc.edu">Ellen Skelly</a> to make arrangements. Print photos will be returned after they are scanned.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering, the not-so-technical due date is &quot;as soon as you can.&quot; In other words, pictures are being gathered now, and will continue to be accepted.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p></div></div>
