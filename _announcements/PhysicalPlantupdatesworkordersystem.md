<div><font size=2>From: Rich Soderquist, director of facilities and campus safety</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>Beginni</font><font size=2>ng with the Fall 2011 semester, the Physical Plant Department will be updating the campus work order system. <br></font></div>
<div><font size=2></font> </div>
<div><font size=2>The new system will include the current School Dude system, along with a telephone help desk and email address (similar to ITS). Phone requests will be taken for all situations that need immediate attention. The email system will be used for non-emergencies requests. School Dude will continue to be used for all types of requests, but will focus on repair projects, furniture moves, and building or room modifications. Please note that event set ups should continue to be requested through R25. Through School Dude the physical plant department will track labor resources, schedule planned maintenance, and develop internal labor reports and projections. The blue card system will be phased out as the new help desk system is introduced. Once the help desk system is fully functioning, the blue card system will be discontinued. </font></div>

<div><font size=2>More information and details will be forth coming. <br></div></font></div></div>
