<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass162E781FA40845178EDEEE45FA8CF557"><p>​The excitement of the greatest sport in the world will dawn at KCC this week when a ping pong tournament returns to the College Center Dec. 17, 18, 21 and 22. <img alt="Ping.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Ping.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" /></p>
<p>KCC employees and student workers are invited to join. Matches will begin Dec. 17, and will be held until a champion is crowned shortly before noon on Dec. 22. Trophies/prizes may not be awarded, so be ready to play for pride.</p>
<p>The registration deadline is 4 p.m. Dec. 15. </p>
<p>In brief, each match will be best two-out-of-three; and each game will be played to 21, but the winner must win by 2. Participants can use their own paddles if they choose. Scoring will use the honor system. </p>
<p>In the spirit of holiday giving, the entry fee is to make a donation to a non-perishable food bank or clothing drive (such as a donation barrel). The honor system will be used in meeting this requirement.</p>
<p>For complete rules, to sign up, or for more information, contact Ellen Skelly at 815-802-8279 or email <a href="mailto:eskelly@kcc.edu">eskelly@kcc.edu</a>. Brackets will be sent to participants Dec. 16 and will be on display at the tournament site. <br /> </p></div></div>
