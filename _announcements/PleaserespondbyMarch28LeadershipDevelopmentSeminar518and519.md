<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassB4D157B603214DAFB3AC393083F4C17A><div><font size=2><strong>From: by Dr. John Avendano, president</strong></font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>All full-time faculty, staff and administrators are invited to attend the 2011 Leadership Development Seminar, “The Individual and the Team.”</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>Leaders are essential at all levels of an institution in order for it to move from good to great. The purpose of this seminar is to discover how one’s position either as a faculty or staff member plays an important part in the success of the college and the students it serves.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>The seminar will be Wednesday and Thursday, May 18 and 19, 2011.  For the experience to be most effective, we must limit the number of participants to 20.  This is the seventh year that KCC has held this leadership seminar and our hope is that it will be as valuable to a new group of leaders as it has been in the past.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>The seminar will be at the Inn at Starved Rock Lodge and Conference Center in Utica, where participants will stay overnight. All applicants must be able to attend the entire seminar.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>If you are a full-time employee interested in attending, please e-mail Bert Jacobson (</font><a href="mailto:bjacobson@kcc.edu"><font size=2>bjacobson@kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2>) indicating your interest by March 28.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>We are looking forward to again participating in this valuable and fun seminar.  Please consider joining us and adding your voice to that of other leaders at KCC.</font></div></div></div>
