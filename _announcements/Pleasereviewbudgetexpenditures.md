<div> </div>
<div>The Accounting and Business Office would like to remind all budget officers to review their expenditures against their departmental budgets.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since we are more than half-way through this fiscal year, now is a great time to prepare budget transfer requests to cover amounts over spent to ensure you do not exceed your allocated budget for Fiscal Year 2014.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To learn more, please contact me, Beth Nunley, 815-802-8142 or Brenda Dressler, 815-802-8135. Thank you in advance!</div></div></div>
