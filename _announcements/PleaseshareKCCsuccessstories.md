<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass9BAD978F2923461EB5B3B7EC32B09839><div>KCC is in need of students and alumni to participate in upcoming opportunities to promote the college.</div>
<div><br>Suggestions for students who would make good representatives of KCC are appreciated. The people suggested will be considered for future photo sessions or testimonial advertisements. The college also frequently uses alumni in its advertisements. </div>
<div><br>To best represent the true diversity of our college, the marketing department attempts to represent our student body using an appropriate proportion of age groups, programs of study, genders, ethnicities and hometowns. Receiving suggestions from throughout the college will help meet this goal.</div>
<div><br>To suggest a student or graduate for college promotions, contact Kari Sargeant at <a href="mailto:ksargeant@kcc.edu">ksargeant@kcc.edu</a> or phone her at 815-802-8256.</div>
