<div>KCC will take part in the Stand Against Racism movement, organized nationally by the YWCA.<br /> <br />At KCC, from April 22 to 26, students, staff and faculty can visit KCC’s main reception desk to make a resolution against racism, to sign the college’s registry, and to receive an orange and white “KCC Stands Against Racism” rubber wristband.<br /> <br />“KCC is proud to make its own ‘stand,’” said Oshunda Carpenter Williams, a member of the Cultural Diversity Committee, which is organizing the event at KCC. <br /> <br />Stand Against Racism is a national movement of the YWCA to bring together like-minded organizations that share in their vision of eliminating racism and celebrating the richness of diversity. <br /> <br />For more information about the event at KCC, contact Oshunda at 815-802-8513.</div>
