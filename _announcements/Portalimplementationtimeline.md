<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass8C7F7AD6C55F4C7E905C5EE97E280C0F"><p>​The portal implementation is underway, and on schedule to be live by the end of June.</p>
<p>Here's the timeline being used for the project:</p>
<ul><li>August 2016 – Information sessions w/students/faculty/staff</li>
<li>September 2016 – Finalization of project scope</li>
<li>September 2016* – “Scoping” call with Ellucian</li>
<li>October 2016 – Board of Trustees Meeting</li>
<li>January 2017* – Development/design work begin</li>
<li>March 2017 – Standup test portal site</li>
<li>April 2017 – Production portal site built</li>
<li>May 2017 – Begin populating portal site/Training of content editors</li>
<li>June 29, 2017 – KCC’s Portal goes LIVE</li></ul>
<p>Note: although the project is on schedule, some dates are dependent on <a href="http://www.ellucian.com/">Ellucian</a>, the software development company. Ellucian also is the software company for Colleague, the KCC <a href="http://www.ellucian.com/Software/Student-Information-Systems/">Student Information System.</a></p>
<p>One thing to glean from the timeline is that portal training is near. Editors of KCC's website received a message on April 21 inviting them to learn to edit portal content.</p>
<p>The training will be a two-hour session, with six times to choose from, on May 10 and 11. If you are a content editor and did not receive an invitation to training, contact <a href="mailto:moconnor@kcc.edu">Mike O'Connor</a>.</p>
<p>Once the portal is populated and live, it will continue to evolve. Information will continue to migrate to it. Elements on the portal page might move or change to serve constituents better. In other words, users will probably see new/different things every now and then.</p>
<p>Anyone with questions about the portal project is invited to contact <a href="mailto:moconnor@kcc.edu">Michael O’Connor</a> or <a href="mailto:knugent@kcc.edu">Kari Nugent</a>, who are leading the implementation team.​</p></div></div>
