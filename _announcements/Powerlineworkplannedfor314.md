<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass2E84E1BF280449F19E6BDD5097BC28E6"><p>​KCC's Physical Plant Department is coordinating with Commonwealth Edison to arrange for the Riverfront Campus power lines to be moved underground. </p>
<p>The change is planned for Saturday, March 14, a day when the college is closed. Com Ed will completely shut power down at the Riverfront Campus during the switchover. </p>
<p>There is no estimate on how long the work will take. Power should be restored before normal operations resume on Monday, March 16.</p>
<p>Because its studios are on the Riverfront Campus, <a href="/wkcc">WKCC 91.1 FM</a> will not be broadcasting during the outtage. The college website will be unaffected. </p>
