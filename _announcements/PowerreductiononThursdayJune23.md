<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass0F8BD88AD78C483D8142BCD8C50C6C74"><p>​A message from Rich Soderquist, director of Facilities and Campus Safety<br /><br />Power will be reduced on KCC’s Riverfront Campus from 12:30-2 p.m. on Thursday, June 23 while we participate in the ComEd’s Peak Demand Response Program. <br /><br />Essential services will still be available, and it will not interrupt classes in session, advising or student registration. <br /><br />ComEd will determine our future rate based on consumption during the hour and a half. <br /><br />You are encouraged to turn off computers, office lights and other electric-consuming devices during this time. Options for this time could include taking your lunch break and working on tasks that don’t require electricity. <br /><br />Employees at the other locations will not be affected. More information will follow next week. <br /></p></div></div>
