<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass41226D09D9414DF0A82AD5A5215E5DCC"><p><a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/ForumInfographic2017.pdf"><img alt="ForumInfogrph.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/ForumInfogrph.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" /></a>An <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/ForumInfographic2017.pdf">infographic</a> is being shared to help you prepare for the strategic planning open forum.</p>
<p>The graphic summarizes outcomes from the current plan, key data trends, and ongoing enrollment efforts. The audience will be asked to help generate ideas for future enrollment activities.</p>
<p>The open forum will focus on enrollment and takes place tomorrow, Sept. 6 from 3-5 p.m. in the Auditorium. Faculty and staff are all invited to attend.</p>
<p>“Our current institutional strategic plan concludes in 2018, and enrollment is the biggest strategic challenge right now,” said Dr. Michael Boyd, vice president for Instructional and Student Success. “Instead of working on another long-range strategic plan, let’s design an alternate strategy, with an intense and specific action plan, aimed at increasing enrollment.” </p>
<p>The Strategic Planning Oversight Committee (SPOC) is hosting the forum. Afterward, SPOC will use the ideas generated to determine future strategic priorities. Action teams will be organized for each of the strategic priorities. The teams will develop measurements, action steps, and accountability plans to ensure progress and results.</p>
<p>&quot;We all have an important role to play as we face challenges related to current enrollment trends,” Mike said. “We hope you’ll join us at the forum.” </p></div></div>
