<p><img alt="D_Price_update.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/D_Price_update.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />A native of Tamms, and a graduate of Egyptian High School, Price led KCC in points (15.7 per game), rebounds (6.5 average), steals (1.5), and three point percentage (44.8%) this season. Price, a 6-foot 2-inch guard, was named to the All-Region 4 First Team and also was the Region 4 tournament Most Valuable Player. The Cavaliers won the Division I Region 4 Championship March 2 by defeating Kennedy-King College of Chicago in overtime, 73-61.</p>
<p>“Devantae was an extremely important part of our championship team this season,” said third-year KCC Head Coach Julian Springer. “I’m excited for him and his family.”</p>
<p>Price is one of only 12 NJCAA Division I players selected to play for the West All-Stars in the NJCAA Men’s Basketball Association All-Star Game in Las Vegas on May 9. </p>
<p>The Cavaliers finished the season with 24 wins and 9 losses. As the regular season ended, they were ranked no. 1 in Region 4, with a 10-2 record. The Region 4 championship was the team’s fourth in the last 15 years. </p>
<p>Price will graduate this spring with an Associate in Arts transfer degree. He is considering his transfer options for playing at a four-year college next year. <br />Overall, the Cavaliers have had 25 All-Americans. Last season, Kankakee native Alvin Braddock was a second team All-American for the Cavaliers. He transferred and played forward for Southern Arkansas University this season.<br /></p>
