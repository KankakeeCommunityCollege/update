<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass45BBC64CC9274285A9C93F483A7C2F8E"><p>KCC professor Kim DeYoung is one of only nine college employees in the nation to earn a scholarship to the 2015 International Nursing Association for Clinical Simulation &amp; Learning Conference.</p>
<p>&quot;I am appreciative of KCC’s support to simulation and excited to have the college represented in this way,&quot; Kim said. “We started with our simulation program in 2008 and have probably conducted close to 100 simulations, with plans to add an additional pediatric and maternal simulator in the next year.”</p>
<p>Kim was selected from among more than 80 applications for the 2015 conference scholarship. She is one of only nine recipients. There are no other scholarship winners from Illinois, and Kim also is the only community college employee to earn the scholarship. The conference will be June 10-13.</p>
<p>The scholarship covers the conference registration fee, and is provided by Anthony Battaglia, with Pocket Nurse™. Pocket Nurse provides medical supplies for education and medical simulation. Battaglia is the company's president. The scholarship is for educators, learning resource specialists, managers, and students who are interested in the design and development of clinical simulation to enhance education, research, and practice in nursing.<br /></p></div></div>
