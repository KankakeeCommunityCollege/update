<div>Tot ziens. Näkemiin.</div>
<div><br />After spending two weeks in the Kankakee area, plus side trips, two visiting professors have returned to their homelands. </div>
<div><br />KCC’s John Bordeau and Charlie Cooke hosted Jan Heutink from The Netherlands and Panu Kosonen from Finland. Their visit to KCC was part of an exchange program offered through the Illinois Consortium for International Studies and Programs. In May 2014, John will travel to The Netherlands and Charlie will travel to Finland for exchange visits to Jan and Panu’s colleges. They are all pictured at right, on Oct. 14. </div>
<div><br />“It’s been very entertaining and very educational at the same time,” Jan said on one of his final days at KCC. At KCC, he attended a number of classes and made a presentation about his country and their education system. </div>
<div><br />“I’d seen it on TV,” he said about America. “There were big cars and important people. I wanted to see what is ‘normal.’” He wanted to meet people and learn how we live and work, he said. Three of his conclusions: “I’ve found kindly people. I’ve met a lot of people. This is a quiet school in a quiet area.”</div>
<div><br />In addition to meeting and working with KCC staff, Jan also visited Chicago, including “The Ledge” at Willis Tower and the Shedd Aquarium; the Upper Peninsula of Michigan; went to an ice hockey game; attended a pro football game; hiked at the Kankakee River State Park; attended the First Reformed Church of Wichert in St. Anne; and took a tour of the sustainable infrastructure in our community. </div>
<div><br />“The things I’ve wanted to see, I’ve seen,” he said. </div>
<div><br />“It was a learning experience before we even stepped on the campus,” John said. The first weekend together, John and Jan talked about the classes they both taught, and discovered many similarities between them. They also talked about differences such as the age range of students, use of eBooks, and the time allocated to hands-on training. </div>
<div><br />Unfortunately, Panu was not available to be interviewed in the final days of his visit. Charlie shared a number of details on his visit. As with John and Jan, Charlie and Panu spent time making comparisons. </div>
<div><br />Panu took part in a number of air-conditioning classes, as well as electronics courses which are similar to those he teaches, including Industrial Motor Controls, Fundamentals of Electricity and DC &amp; AC Rotating Machines &amp; Drive Trains. The competencies were very comparable, Charlie said. The length of training, and the age of most students is different, he said. </div>
<div><br />Panu had visited New York City and Chicago as a tourist previously. Among the things Charlie said Panu talked about was his interest in what an “average” family was like in America. <br />“I would guess my family is average, because living day-to-day is not like what you may see on television, at least not at my house!” Charlie said. “Panu said he was very grateful for the experience because it was very much like what he experiences every day.”</div>
<div><br />Regarding the complete visit, Charlie said: “It’s been a blast! It gave me an interesting perspective on some of the actual training Panu does and what we do,” Charlie said. “More than training, though, we learned that the problems they have are the same that we have. He and I face a lot of the same battles.”</div>
<div><br />The activities he participated in included a trip to Great America, where he rode in the front car of many roller coasters; shopping at Cabela’s; and a bow hunting trip.</div>
