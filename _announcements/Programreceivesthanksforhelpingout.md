<div><br /> “Yesterday (June 4), we had the good fortune of having the Physical (Therapist) Assistant class from KCC, under Jessica Corbus, put in a full day of work on our facility,” said Bill Barnes, director of development for The Salvation Army of Kankakee County.</div>
<div><br />“It was a day filled with weeding the front and side landscaping, spreading two truckloads of mulch (provided by Snider’s Nursery), painting of exterior doors and main canopy, and installing coat racks in the women's shelter,” Barnes said. “The place looks amazing! Our heartfelt thanks go out to all who participated in making our facility look even better!”</div>
<div><br />Jessica is director of Physical Therapist Assistant Program.</div>
<div><br />The pictures show the group as well as individuals at work throughout the day.</div>
