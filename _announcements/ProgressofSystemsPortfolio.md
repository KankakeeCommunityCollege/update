<div>The Systems Portfolio, a required document for re-accreditation, will be complete by November 2013.</div>
<div><br />A team of four people is overseeing data collection, writing and editing of the Systems Portfolio.</div>
<div><br />The team is Vicki Magee, Scott Stewart, Paul Carlson and Monica Quinlan. Dennis Sorensen, vice president for instructional and student success, is responsible for the completion of the portfolio. </div>
<div><br />The data collection team is meeting weekly and following a timeline to complete the portfolio. Meeting notes are available on O:\Share\KCC\Committees\Systems Portfolio.</div>
<div><br />The writers for each category are:<br />Category One -- Helping Students Learn: Scott Stewart;<br />Category Two -- Accomplishing Distinctive Objectives: Paul Carlson;<br />Category Three -- Understanding Students’ and Other Stakeholders’ Needs: Monica Quinlan;<br />Category Four -- Valuing People: Vicki Magee;<br />Category Five -- Leading and Communicating: Paul Carlson;<br />Category Six -- Supporting Organizational Operations: Monica Quinlan;<br />Category Seven -- Measuring Institutional Effectiveness: Vicki Magee;<br />Category Eight -- Continuous Quality Improvement: Vicki Magee; and<br />Category Nine -- Building Collaborative Relationships: Paul Carlson.</div>
<div><br />In the fall, a new Systems Portfolio Committee will be formed and will include three faculty members.</div>
<div><br />Those who have served on the Systems Portfolio Advisory Group during 2011-2012 will no longer formally meet. Members of this group may be asked to review drafts of the portfolio, as will all KCC employees and selected students. <br /></div>
<div>The portfolio is part of the process for KCC to maintain accreditation from the Higher Learning Commission, which is a member of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools. KCC is accredited through 2016.</div>
<div><br />The portfolio provides a 100 page 'snapshot' of KCC processes and data. A systems appraisal is conducted every four years to highlight areas for improvements at the college. KCC submitted the first systems portfolio in November 2005 and the second in November 2009.</div>
<div><br />Anyone with questions about the accreditation process is invited to contact <a href="mailto:vmagee@kcc.edu">Vicki</a> or <a href="mailto:dsorensen@kcc.edu">Dennis</a>.<br /></div>
