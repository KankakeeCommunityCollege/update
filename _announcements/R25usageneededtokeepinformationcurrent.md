<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassE9F6539A23534232B61BF23AB13E9170><div><font size=2>    The colleges room management and event scheduling software, Resource 25, should be used as the calendar for all college events--regardless of event location.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    Resource 25 gives event information and open rooms only when it is used as designed to reserve spaces and show events.</div>
<div><br>    To view events with R25, go to </font><a href="http://r25.kcc.edu"><font size=2>http://r25.kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2> or </font><a href="http://calendar.kcc.edu"><font size=2>http://calendar.kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2>.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    The calendar displays scheduled events--including classes--by day, week or month. Academic calendar events--such as holidays, last day to pay and finals week--also are on R25.</div>
<div><br>    Room requesters are reminded that naming events descriptively and placing events into appropriate categories (i.e. Open to the Public, Hot Events, Athletic Events, Student Activities) becomes very important, so the information on this site is helpful to our public audience.</div>
<div><br>    Resources necessary for an event such as refreshments, technology support or room layout are requested at the time the event is scheduled. Service providers such as the media department, Information Technology Services, the Learning Resource Center, Physical Plant Department and food service are automatically notified.  <br> </font></div></div></div>
