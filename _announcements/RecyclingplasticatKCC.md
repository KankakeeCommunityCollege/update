<p><span style="color:darkblue"></span>Did you know that every ton of plastic bottles recycled saves about 3.8 barrels of oil?</p>
<p>The plastics industry realized more than 20 years ago that recycling plastics was an eco-friendly endeavor. Back in 1988 a numbering system was created to make the sorting of the different plastics easier for everyone. The numbers 1 to 7 are surrounded by the circle of triangles, usually at the bottom of the plastic article.  Each number signifies a different kind of plastic. </p>
<p>KCC’s recycling program collects the plastic water and beverage bottles made from number 1 plastic.  Numbers 1, 2, 4 and 5 listed on the <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Plastic-Recycling1.pdf">attachment</a> represent over 96 percent of all the plastic bottles and containers used in the United States. While KCC’s program does not accept plastic waste from your home, we do hope you will include these four recyclable plastics in your household recycling routine.</p>

<p><em>Editor's note</em>: The attached <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Plastic-Recycling1.pdf">document about recycling plastic</a> includes the above information, what what each number means, and locations where some of the &quot;rare&quot; plastics can be recycled. <br /></p>
