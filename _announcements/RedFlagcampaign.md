<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC3373673303F4E38AC60E4CCDDD8D48A"><p>Kankakee Community College is addressing dating violence through a new “Red Flag Campaign.”<br /><br />The public awareness campaign will begin on Sept. 22 when several small red flags will be placed in the main courtyard. Please do not mention the flags to students prior to Sept. 22. <br /><br />The week of Sept. 29, the full campaign will launch in conjunction with Domestic Violence Awareness Month in October. Information will be distributed around campus and on KCC’s webpage which focuses on domestic violence awareness and prevention. <br /><br />Designed with a “bystander intervention” strategy, the campaign encourages friends and other campus community members to “say something” when they see warning signs of dating violence. The campaign features eight posters that illustrate “red flags” that might be indicators of dating violence: coercion, emotional abuse, sexual assault, victim-blaming, excessive jealousy, isolation, and stalking. <br /><br />The Kankakee County Center Against Sexual Assault (KC-CASA) will also be at KCC on Tuesday, Sept. 30 from 10 a.m. - 1 p.m. in the College Center to promote domestic violence and sexual assault prevention and make students and staff aware of support assistance and resources.  <br /><br />“As college employees, the well-being of students is of great importance to all of us. And as a person who understands student development, you know that one of students’ greatest interests on campus is seeking out relationships with their peers—both friendships and dating relationships,” said Laura Gardner, student life coordinator. “Unfortunately, we also know that many relationships are not healthy or positive.  “The Red Flag Campaign” encourages students to speak up when they see red flags for dating violence in relationships. It is our hope that the campaign will generate a lot of interest and discussion on campus.” <br /><br />The initiative is a partnership between KCC and the Office of Student Life.
