<div><br /></font>If you are frustrated with the resources that students turn in as “research” and want to show them a better way, the library can help!</div>
<div><br />Librarians are available to offer Library Orientation and Library Instruction. If neither session meets your needs, the staff will work with you to create a customized session.<br /></div>
<div>Library Orientation typically involves a tour of the Learning Resource Center, pointing out where services are located. It can include a session in the computer lab with demonstrations of KCC’s online catalog and at least one database. We also can help design library assignments and/or scavenger hunts.</div>
<div><br />Library Instruction is more involved than an orientation. For it, a librarian will come to your class and present LRC and internet resources specific to an assignment or topic. Students will not only learn where to find information, but how to search effectively for it and evaluate its content and reliability.</div>
<div><br />For more information or to set up a session for your class, please contact me, Tracy Hilgendorf, at </font><a href="mailto:thilgendorf@kcc.edu"><font size="2">thilgendorf@kcc.edu</font></a><font size="2"> or </font><span style="white-space:nowrap" class="baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1"><font size="2">815-802-8403</font></span><font size="2">.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />Note: For an even better handle on research, you can recommend that students enroll in LRCS 1512, Library and Information Literacy, an eight-week, two-credit course that goes into more depth on choosing sources, search strategies, evaluation, and more.</div>
