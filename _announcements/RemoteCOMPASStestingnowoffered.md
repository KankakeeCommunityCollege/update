<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass8C5222678DDA4EE8938D200FA8EAB4FF><div> <font size=2>    The Testing Office now offers remote testing, so students who are going to another college and need to take their COMPASS test can schedule with that college, but take the test at KCC. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    Students will be able to use the test packages of the school they will be attending and that school's COMPASS units. </div>
<div><br>    Therefore, the procedure saves KCC money. The college to be attended also will have immediate access to the scores.</div>
<div><br>    The fee the student pays is $25. It can be paid in the Accounting Office.</div>
<div><br>    For more information, contact Denise Burklow at 815-802-8518 or Gisel Waide at 815-802-8531.<br> <br>Reminders from the Testing Center</div>
<div><br>-- During finals week, May 9-12, the Testing Center extended hours will be 9 a.m. - 7 p.m. Monday through Thursday.   </div>
<div><br>-- When submitting a make-up coversheet: (1) faculty are asked to include their full name, (2) include the course number and name, and (3) make sure the student's name is the same as on the class roster.<br> </font></div></div></div>
