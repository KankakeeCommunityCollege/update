<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassC2495FE9A8D44DEDA44A84C5067852BB><div><font size=2>    The public safety department and the safety and security committee would like to re-institute the concept of a volunteer floor watch. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    These are staff members who make sure everyone in assigned areas throughout the college are aware and compliant during emergency situations. </div>
<div><br>    The volunteers assist Physical Plant staff when evacuation or shelter-in-place procedures may be needed. Ultimately, we are looking for enough volunteers to cover all campus areas during both day and evening hours. </div>
<div><br>    If the program moves forward, an information meeting will be held for volunteers.</div>
<div><br>    The program would begin with the fall semester. To volunteer, contact Rich Soderquist at 815-802-8173 or Eric Springer at 815-802-8195.<br></div></font></div></div>
