<div>Respiratory Care Week is Oct. 23 to 29.</div>
<div>Lung Health Day is Oct. 26.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Both events are sponsored by the American Association for Respiratory Care.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As part of the Respiratory Care Week observance, students in KCC’s Respiratory Therapist program and Ventilator Society Club will have a table with information in the atrium area near the first floor receptionist desk from 9 a.m. - 3 p .m. on Oct. 24, 26 and 28.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each person who participates can enter into a drawing for a prize.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The five-question self-screening sheet and other information the students will provide was developed as part of a two-year DRIVE 4 COPD campaign for awareness of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease). COPD is a chronic lung disease that makes it harder and harder to breathe. Twenty-four million Americans may have COPD without knowing it. More information about COPD is at <a href="http://www.drive4copd.com/">www.drive4COPD.com</a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC has an Associate in Applied Science degree in Respiratory Therapist. Respiratory therapists provide care and treatment to patients suffering from breathing disorders, and also may be involved in diagnostic testing, clinical <br>supervision and decision-making. KCC’s two-year program includes theory, clinical practice and professional training.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The KCC program faculty are Nancy Ozee and Kelli Jandura.</div>
