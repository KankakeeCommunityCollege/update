<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass6D7D53A3579F42EC97DC8747EB2396AA"><div>Following are responses from those who attended two recent events, a film as well as author meet-and-greet, both sponsored by the Cultural Diversity Committee and Office of Student Life. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>About 40 participants attended each program.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>According to comments from attendees, the film &quot;Crossing Borders&quot; presented cultural information on the people and country of Morocco, including that of a wall which is being built to keep Moroccans out of the area of the country dominated by Spain.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>Crossing Borders documents the experiences of American students visiting the homes and families of students in Morocco. A theme of the movie is intercultural understanding. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The film shows Muslim youth of other nations and shares their preceptions of the United States and Americans. In the end, as one attendee observed, “We are truly blessed as Americans and we take it all for granted.”</div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Educating ourselves about other cultures helps us to appreciate the uniqueness of those cultures but also shows us that people are pretty much all the same,” was the type of comment made by several students. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>“With different views and backgrounds, people can still smile and be happy and interact with other human beings just as anyone would,” another student added.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“We need to think about other people when we live our lives,” was another comment. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the other event, author Tom DeWolf discussed his book, &quot;Inheriting the Trade&quot; and talked of the path he took with his cousins to follow the family slave trading route from “Rhode Island to Cuba to Ghana, Africa.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Tom was very informative,” students agreed. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I learned a lot that I never knew before,&quot; one student added. &quot;The most touching part of the whole event was when he explained that the slaves went to Ghana and were put into the dungeons until they were transported. He described about how the dungeons were tiny, only 450 square feet. And each, being that small, held up to 200 men and women with no bathrooms, and only three tiny holes for air flow. With Ghana being so close to the equator, he explained how hot and humid he was just being in the space for only a few minutes and he explained how he broke down when he pictured what the slaves went through.”</div>
<div><br />“Mr. DeWolf feels strongly that we can break out of cycles of violence and heal ourselves and that many are overwhelmed by problems,” summarized another attendee. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Mr. DeWolf's information was engrossing and it was obvious that he holds a great deal of passion for this topic,” concluded another.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The smooth sound of Chapman’s Trio played as a prelude to the program, and DeWolf commented that “jazz has deep roots connecting to African American slave history.”</div>
<div><br />Both the film, &quot;Crossing Borders&quot; and Tom DeWolf’s book, &quot;Inheriting the Trade&quot; are available in the KCC Learning Resource Center for review and classroom use.  </div>
