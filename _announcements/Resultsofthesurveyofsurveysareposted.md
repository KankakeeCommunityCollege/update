<div><font color="#ff0000"><strong>Submitted by the Office of Institutional Research<br /></strong></font> <br />Thank you to everyone who completed the recent survey to assess the effectiveness of surveys used at KCC.<br /></div>
<div>In all, 116 employees participated.<br /></div>
<div>Go to the <a href="/Community/Collegeinfo/ie/ir/databook/Pages/default.aspx">Institutional Research webpage, Data Book section for results</a>. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Some highlights of the findings:<br />. Most report completing 5 surveys over the past year.<br />. 54.9% report being satisfied with the number of surveys; 22.5% say they are asked to complete too many surveys; and 22.5% have no opinion about the number of surveys.<br />. 90.3% are likely or very likely to complete KCC surveys.<br />. 82% of respondents have completed the Employee Satisfaction Survey. Of all respondents, 76.8% report the Employee Satisfaction is an effective assessment tool.<br />. 98% agree/strongly agree that they appreciate KCC’s efforts to get employee feedback through surveys.<br />. 75.2% agree/strongly agree that survey results are used to make improvements.<br />. 89.5% of those who responded agree/strongly agree that surveys are confidential.<br />. 85.9% agree/strongly agree they are satisfied with the distribution of survey results.<br /> <br />Examples of quality improvement recommendations made by KCC employees in the survey:<br />. Continue to provide incentives (and make incentives more substantial).<br />. Although surveys are confidential, give a public thanks to survey participants.<br />. Provide unedited results of surveys.<br />. Create a process to identify recommendations employees make for quality improvements and act on that input.<br />. Distribute information about the quality improvements made based on survey participants’ feedback.<br /> <br />Based on survey results:<br />. In the past, survey results were not routinely made public. In the future, the Office of Institutional Research will post survey results, beginning with the “survey of surveys.” Those results are posted. In addition, an Update article will announce availability of survey results.<br />. This year a free drink at the Hammes Café was offered as an incentive for completing the Employee Satisfaction Survey. The continuation of an incentive will be considered.<br />. A quality improvement process for distribution of survey results will be developed by the Office of Institutional Research.<br />Any employee with feedback regarding this survey can contact Vicki Magee, director of institutional research, 815-802-8258.</div>
