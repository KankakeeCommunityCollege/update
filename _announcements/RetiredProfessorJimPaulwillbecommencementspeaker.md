<p>Paul taught history and philosophy courses at KCC for 34 years until his retirement in 2006.</p>
<p>As a KCC professor, Paul introduced a number of courses in areas of history and philosophy. In 1979, he offered the first biennial Western Civilization through Independent Study and Travel [to Europe] course. In 1980, he introduced the Death and Dying course at KCC. In 1982, he “team taught” the Ascent of Man course with Lou Anderson for several years. In 1990, he initiated the History of Latin America course. Paul also taught Western Civilization courses and Introduction to Philosophy courses for more than 30 years. Toward the end of his teaching career, in 2004, he began offering several courses online.<br />While an instructor at KCC, Paul also served as the second KCC Faculty Association president from 1989-93.</p>
<p>From 2000 to 2006, Paul’s Western Civilization students interviewed local individuals of French-Canadian descent and created The <a href="/frenchcanadians">French-Canadian Interview Project website</a>.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">“Few experiences in my more than 30 years of college teaching have given me the joy I felt when my students became connected with their community and local history during this project,” he said. The historical wall on the east end of KCC’s third floor is a tribute to this student work.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Paul has a bachelor’s degree in history from St. Meinrad College, a Master of Arts in history degree from Southern Illinois University and a Doctor of Arts degree in history from Illinois State University.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Presently, he volunteers in altruistic activities of the Knights of Columbus Notre Dame Council 7072; as a master gardener; as secretary in the Kankakee County Historic Preservation Commission; as chairperson of the Perry Farm Living History Advisory Committee; as chairperson of the Bourbonnais Grove Historical Society Board of Trustees; and as vice-president of the Bourbonnais Grove Historical Society.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Paul lives in Bourbonnais with his wife, Patricia. He enjoys gardening at home, biking, walking, golf, traveling with family and friends, and babysitting for his granddaughter and grandson.</font></p>
