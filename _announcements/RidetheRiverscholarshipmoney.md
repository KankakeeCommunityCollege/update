<p>As Kendrick Williamson approaches his second full year in college, it is the memories of a rose bush, cutting grass and playing ball that keep him motivated.</font></p></div>
<div><font size="2">  <br />“If anyone tells you that a memory can’t shape your life, don’t believe them,” Williamson said. “I am a student at KCC, pursuing my degree in horticulture, and memories from my childhood are what brought me back to college.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />“When I finish my degree, my goal is to open my own business – perhaps as a wholesaler in the floral industry, or a landscape architect. I have lived in this community my entire life, and plan to stay here after I finish college.”</div>
<div><br />Williamson, 41, received the $1,000 2012-13 Central Illinois Green Club Scholarship from the Kankakee Community College Foundation. The club funded its scholarship with entry fees and sponsorships for “Ride the River,” a vintage tractor ride. The biennial event has been held three times. Williamson’s scholarship was paid for through proceeds from the first two events.</div>
<div><br />“I will be forever grateful to the donors who have helped fund my education,” Williamson said. “Today, even the most affordable college education can be a strain. But thanks to these scholarships, that burden is lighter.”</div>
<div><br />Following the 2012 ride, held Aug. 25, the Green Club made a $12,252.47 donation to the KCC Foundation. It was their largest single donation to date. Through donations from all three rides, the fund now has enough money to endow a scholarship each year, even if additional money is not added.</div>
<div><br />The August ride included 159 tractors which wound through the county’s countryside, along the Kankakee River, to enjoy a 52-mile ride.</div>
<div><br />Williamson and April Papineau, the other 2012-13 Green Club Scholarship recipient, helped by setting up refreshments and passing out water at the rest stop locations.</div>
<div><br />“I brought my 6-year-old son,” Williamson said. “It was a wonderful event. It is something we will never forget. I’d like to return to help again.”</div>
<div><br />“We knew we had to do something to give back to the community,” said Nancy Evans, secretary of the Central Illinois Green Club. “In these economic times, it’s hard to imagine that people would be so generous. Those kids are our future.</div>
<div><br />“We were blessed to have enough sponsors to cover expenses. So all of the money from registrations go directly to the scholarship.”</div>
<div><br />Evans said another part of the ride’s success was that it was organized by tractor enthusiasts who had experience with planning and participating in similar rides.</div>
<div><br />“We didn’t want it to be expensive,” she said. “We wanted it to be reasonable. We wanted it to be one day of fun. We’ve had a great time doing it.”</div>
<div><br />Members of the Central Illinois Green Club would like to stay connected to the scholarship winners.</div>
<div><br />“We’re hoping to get the scholarship winners involved in our club,” Evans said. “They are so grateful and we know that they couldn’t go to school without that scholarship. We’re hoping to develop a relationship between them and our club. I don’t think any club does well unless it finds its purpose. Raising money for that was our way of giving back to the community.”</div>
