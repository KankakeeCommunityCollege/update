<div><font size="2">Riverside Medical Center is partnering with FastCare retail health clinics to open the Riverside Medical Center FastCare clinic in Bourbonnais.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"><br />The clinic, currently under construction, will be located in the Walmart store at 2080 N. State Route 50 in Bourbonnais. It is scheduled to open in October.<br /></font></div>
<div><font size="2">This information is being shared with KCC employees because there are many cases where using the clinic would save both time and money, according to David Cagle, director of human resources.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />“Instead of having our employees or our students visit an ER after hours or on weekends/holiday if they are sick, they can go to FastCare beginning Oct. 3 without an appointment and be treated by a PA (physician’s assistant) or nurse practitioner,” David said. “Cost is $59, and employees would just pay their $20 deductible and they would bill our insurance for the $39 balance. Part-time employees or students would have to pay the full $59 rate, which is still very affordable, especially compared to ER visits.”</div>
<div><br />Riverside's FastCare clinic will offer care for minor conditions and symptoms such as sore throats, fevers, flu and colds, ear, sinus and urinary tract infections, pink eye, skin rashes and allergies as well as other non-emergency illnesses.</div>
<div><br />Aspects of the FastCare facility include: minimal waiting periods, walk-ins only, no appointments necessary; open 364 days a year, with day and evening hours; availability of immediate, local medical care; quality care provided by a nurse practitioner; easy transmittal of prescriptions to a pharmacy of choice; and services offered for a flat fee which can be billed to a patient's insurance.</div>
