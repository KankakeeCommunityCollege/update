<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass30662C9260994448BB7A07E0CD99D45B"><p>​Students in Kankakee Community College’s Student Advisory Council are raising money for a local child battling cancer.<br /><br />The students are holding a fundraiser to assist the family of Austin Barnett, a 10-year-old Limestone Elementary student who has been fighting Medulloblastoma brain and spinal cancer since 2010. Five years ago, Barnett was first diagnosed with the disease. He had two years of remission beginning in 2011 before the disease came back in 2013. Then, most recently, following chemotherapy which seemed to work, an MRI test revealed the cancer has returned. <br /><br />Each year the KCC Student Advisory Council raises funds to support a local person or charity organization. All KCC student clubs and organizations are encouraged to participate.<br /><br />Club members will be collecting donations at various times in the College Center from Monday, April 6 to Friday, May 1 as part of a “Choose the Torture” fundraiser. KCC’s President, Dr. John Avendano has committed to participating in their fundraising efforts to support Austin. Donations will be collected to decide which challenge Dr. Avendano will be completing on May 7. Challenges include: dress like a KCC Cavalier, ice bucket challenge or eat bad jelly beans. <br /><br />All proceeds will be donated to Austin Barnett and his family. <br />The community is invited to participate. Donations payable to Kankakee Community College can be mailed to: ATTN Student Activities (Austin Barnett Fund) Kankakee Community College, 100 College Drive, Kankakee, IL 60901.<br /><br />For more information, phone Laura Gardner, KCC student life coordinator at 815-802-8628 or email <a href="mailto:lgardner@kcc.edu">lgardner@kcc.edu</a>.</p>
