<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassF7C220ED99C74195964F91BC9FED4279"><p>​Small Businesses Grow Thanks to KCC Small Business Development Center<br />Melanie DeVore turned a hobby into a dream with the help of the Small Business Development Center (SBDC) at Kankakee Community College (KCC). <br /><br /><img alt="Melanie DeVore- Bliss Bridal and Prom owner_update.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Melanie%20DeVore-%20Bliss%20Bridal%20and%20Prom%20owner_update.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />DeVore had a career in healthcare, but she always loved weddings and party planning. To put her dream into motion and to make extra income, she rented table and chair covers for weddings on the side.<br /><br />DeVore expanded her side job into a full-time business, left her healthcare position, and opened Wedding Bells, a consignment shop, in Bourbonnais, Ill. In addition to table and chair coverings, she rented everything from floral centerpieces to flower girl dresses. <br /><br />“Business was booming, and I followed my instincts to grow,” said DeVore. “When I had an opportunity to join the Wedding Center Bridal Boutique, an existing business, I knew it was the right fit.”<br /><br />Even though DeVore had a business plan in place and was doing well, she couldn’t secure the financing needed to move forward. A friend recommended she call Ken Crite, director of the SBDC at KCC.<br /><br />“Ken was my savior,” said DeVore. “Not only did he review my business plan and set me up with an accountant, he found a bank to loan me the money I needed to grow to the next level.”<br /><br />DeVore joined the Wedding Center in spring 2014. After adding prom wear to its repertoire, the business changed its name to Bliss Bridal and Prom.<br /><br />“I am grateful for the help and connections I’ve made since contacting KCC’s Small Business Center,” said DeVore. “It’s like having an entire team in my back pocket.”<br /><br />KCC’s SBDC provides entrepreneurs with comprehensive information and access to experts in many fields in order to start and/or grow successful businesses. <br /><br />The SBDC offers seminars on topics of interest to small business owners including developing a business plan, sales tax compliance, marketing, and financing a business; SCORE, individual counseling and mentoring via a joint partnership between the SBDC and the Kankakee River Valley Chamber of Commerce; and assistance in connecting with local, state, and federal agencies. <br /><br />“Illinois Small Business Development Centers are located throughout the state, and the network has been in existence for 30 years,” said Crite. “We provide information, confidential business guidance, training, and other resources to start-up and existing small businesses.”<br /><br /><img alt="Melanie Alejandre Goodberlet Home Services, Inc. owner_update.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Melanie%20Alejandre%20Goodberlet%20Home%20Services,%20Inc.%20owner_update.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />Melanie Alejandre worked for Goodberlet Home Services, Inc., of Kankakee, Ill., for over 10 years when an opportunity came up to buy the business. <br /><br />“The owner was ready to retire, and he asked me if I was interested in buying the business,” said Alejandre. “I contacted the SBDC for assistance and saved a lot of time and money because I was pointed to the correct resources right off the bat.”<br /><br />Alejandre took advantage of the seminars offered by the SBDC. She also secured financing for her business with SBDC assistance. <br /><br />Since she’s bought Goodberlet Home Services, Inc., in 2014, Alejandre has expanded, opening two more locations and hiring seven people.<br /><br />“I wouldn’t have been able to grow so much in a short period of time without the help of the SBDC,” said Alejandre. “The growth is exciting. I like to hire and offer jobs.” <br /><br />Crite’s expertise has proven valuable to many business owners like Alejandre. In addition to being director of KCC’s SBDC since 1990, he is also a small business owner and entrepreneur. He can relate to the more than 170 clients the SBDC sees yearly.<br /><br />“Through my personal experiences as well as the network of people we have available, we can provide assistance with most any situation,” said Crite.<br /><br /><img alt="Lance Murray- Victory Bowling Lanes Owner_update.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Lance%20Murray-%20Victory%20Bowling%20Lanes%20Owner_update.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />Since Lance Murray was eight-years-old, he was involved in bowling. He was employed at pro shops and bowling centers before he bought Victory Bowling Lanes of Kankakee in the 1990s. <br /><br />When Murray decided to upgrade his business in 2014, he had trouble securing the financing he needed. He called everyone—so he thought—until a friend suggested he called the SBDC. <br /><br />“It was a step in the right direction calling the SBDC,” said Murray. “I was able to get the money needed to update and keep my family establishment running.”<br /><br />The SBDC serves Kankakee County as well as parts of Grundy, Will, and Livingston Counties. Most of the center’s services are free or available for a nominal fee. <br /><br /> “All businesses are unique and there is no ‘one size fits all’ solution,” said Crite. “We work with each client that contacts us to make sure they are getting the assistance needed.”<br /><br />For more information about SBDC services, contact Crite at (815) 802-8222 or email <a href="mailto:krite@kcc.edu">krite@kcc.edu</a>. <br /><br />The Illinois Small Business Development Center programs were developed through a partnership between the U.S. Small Business Administration, the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and KCC as a service to all Illinois small businesses under cooperative agreement #0-7620-0014-17.</p>
