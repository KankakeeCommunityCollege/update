<div>The State Universities Annuitants Association sponsored its first new member drive from July through September.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Following the membership drive, one person and his/her chapter would receive a monetary prize. On Oct. 10, at the SUAA Fall Annual Meeting, the winner was announced as Ruth Fabbro, an assistant professor of developmental mathematics at KCC. Ruth is in her first semester teaching full-time for KCC.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;She joined SUAA soon after (being hired at KCC) because she felt it was important that faculty should be represented in the chapter,&quot; said Claire McElroy, an officer in KCC's SUAA chapter. &quot;Ruth is certainly happy that she chose SUAA to be her voice in the legislature, and her membership makes the voice stronger.&quot;</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ruth received a check for $300 from SUAA and a certificate that was presented by Linda Guinn and Claire. The KCC  chapter also received a certificate and check for $150.</div>
