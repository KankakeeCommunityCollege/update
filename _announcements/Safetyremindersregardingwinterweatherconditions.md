<div> </div>
<div>Weather conditions can change quickly and dramatically. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>With winter upon us, please remember when moving around outside areas of campus to walk slowly and deliberately. Pick your footing carefully. Avoid icy areas and look out for covered or black ice patches. Choose footwear that offers good winter traction, and walk in lighted areas whenever possible. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Windy conditions sometimes produce dangerous gusts as well. Choose routes that offer more shelter, and be aware that even though salt or de-ice is down, it may blow away before making a deep penetration, leaving a false sense of a safe surface.<br></div>
