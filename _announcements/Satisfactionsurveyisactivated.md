<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassCA3E90E64CEA403D90F7328ACDA90155"><p style="color:#00558d">​Submitted by David Cagle, director of human resources</p>
<p>As you should know, the Employee Satisfaction Survey was activated the morning of Feb. 3.</p>
<p>As of Friday morning (Feb. 6), 74 employees have completed it. Our goal is 210 employees, so we are at 35%. There is still plenty of time to take the survey. It will remain active until 11:59 p.m. Saturday, Feb 28.</p>
<p>We are encouraging all full-time employees, current adjunct instructors, and part-time employees averaging 16 hours or more of work per week to complete the employee satisfaction survey, which should take about 20 minutes. Noel-Levitz is administering the survey and--as a third-party--helps assure that answers will be confidential. Information pertaining to individual identities will not be shared.</p>
<p>This is the sixth year we have used Noel-Levitz to administer the survey. It allows for comparison between years to see how we are doing, as well as a comparison to approximately 30 other community colleges across the nation.</p>
<p>So if you haven’t taken the survey yet, please do so. Your feedback is welcomed and valued.</p>
