<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass9B87070E35994141A4FF1F78325DC120><div><strong>From: </strong>Becky Wilder, coordinator of scholarships and annual giving</div>
<div><br>The 2011-12 KCC Foundation Scholarship booklets and applications are now available.</div>
<div><br>Printed scholarship books and applications are at various locations around campus, in the KCC Office of Financial Aid, from area high school counselors, and electronically at <a href="/scholarships">www.kcc.edu/scholarships</a>. </div>
<div><br>The application deadline for most 2011-12 Foundation scholarships is April 8, 2011. Some individual scholarships may have different deadlines, so please check scholarship descriptions carefully. </div>
<div><br>Students often think they can’t qualify for an award, but that isn’t always the case. Scholarships are available for a wide range of students. While some scholarships are based on grades, many focus on factors like a student’s major, potential, interests etc. If a student can maintain a minimum GPA of 2.5, its worth applying for an award. They might be pleasantly surprised.</div>
<div><br>Scholarship categories include those for full- and part time students, occupational and baccalaureate students, middle-income families, recent high school graduates, students whose grades are in the middle range, older students who are returning to school, and a broad spectrum of students with special talents. </div>
<div><br>Faculty and staff are asked to make their students aware of the availability of books and applications, and to encourage students to apply.<br></div></div></div>
