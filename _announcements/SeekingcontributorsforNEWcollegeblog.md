<p align=left>KCC will be launching a NEW college-wide blog &quot;Posts from the Riverfront.&quot; The college-branded blog will kick-off in September. It replaces the five blogs that are currently published, and will feature faculty, staff and students as contributors. </p>
<p>Current KCC bloggers Lindsey Fritz, Emily Skelly and Nancy Schunke will continue to offer their posts with the new format, but other contributors are being sought. Articles or discussions can be one-time or ongoing submissions, and can cover a variety of campus-related topics. Instructors are also encouraged to involve students in contributing posts. </p>
<p>&quot;This new blog is another way to share our stories about KCC life with prospective students and the community, said Nancy Schunke, who coordinates the college’s social media efforts. As the world of social media is evolving, so is our blog. The college’s online community includes students and community members alike, and it is building rapidly.&quot;</p>
<p>To become a KCC blog contributor, please contact Schunke at ext. 8266 or email <a href="mailto:nschunke@kcc.edu">nschunke@kcc.edu</a>.</p></div></div>
