<div><font size="2">Surveys estimate that in Illinois, four million adults over the age of 16 have only basic reading and writing skills. In the Kankakee area, 12,503 adults did not finish high school and 7,424 area residents have less than a ninth grade education, according to statistics compiled by Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />Kankakee Community College’s ALIVE (Adult Literacy Initiative Volunteers Expanded) program addresses these issues in our area, providing individual, classroom and small group tutoring to improve the literacy skills of adults age 16 and older.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Literacy is more than just knowing how to recognize written words,” said Shannan Carrell, program coordinator. “It involves the comprehension of written passages, the ability to follow written directions and simple math skills. On average, ALIVE helps 110 adults every year learn to read. There are multiple sites in Kankakee and Iroquois counties where tutoring is offered.</div>
<div><br />“We want to help people learn to complete daily activities many people take for granted, such as reading the label on groceries, choosing which pump at the gas station and reading to their children.”<br />As part of Literacy Month, KCC’s ALIVE program invites adults who would like to improve their literacy skills to enroll in the ALIVE program. Additionally, adults who have strong literacy skills are asked to volunteer as tutors.</div>
