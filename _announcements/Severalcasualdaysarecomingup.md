<div>The following dates will be casual days: Dec. 16, 19, 20, 21 and Jan. 6. <br /> </div>
<div>As a reminder, casual day guidelines are: </div>
<div> </div>
<div>-- Participation is optional. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>-- Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public information. Prices vary at both locations. Visit the bookstore or Linda Chouinard for more information. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>-- Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>-- Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>-- All employee groups can participate. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>-- Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, jeans may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college. </div>
