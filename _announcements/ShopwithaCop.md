<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass6826173D8CBB43D59A80DE3FC0F37C79"><p>​Sixteen children from five families went shopping for Christmas gifts as part of KCC’s “Shop with a Cop” event Dec. 10.<br /><br /><img width="358" height="239" alt="Janet Fager helps a little one shop" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Shop_with_a_Cop%20-%20Janet_Fager.jpg" style="height:190px;vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px;width:286px" />Each child had $60 to spend for Christmas.  <br /><br />“Most bought their favorite toys,” said Jane Clark, a KCC employee who helped organize the event. “Some bought clothes or other necessities, and some even spent their money on gifts for their mom.”<br /><br />“Walmart was very supportive,” said Rich Soderquist, KCC’s director of facilities and campus security, who serves as the college’s police chief. “They gave a corporate donation, made the check-out process easy and seamless, and they even baked cookies for everyone. <br /><br />KCC’s Police Department and Safety and Security Committee raised money through campus fundraisers. The children were family members of KCC students and staff members who demonstrated financial need or personal hardships.</p>
