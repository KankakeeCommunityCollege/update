<div><font size=2>From: Rich Soderquist, director of facilities and campus safety</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>Beginning Jan. 1, 2013, the Federal Communications Commission is mandating all public safety, institutional, and business license holders for short wave radios to convert existing 25 kHz systems to minimum narrow banding 12.5 kHw technologies.<br>The mandate’s purpose is to promote efficient use of the VHF and UHF land mobile frequency bands. This requires a new application and approved license to legally broadcast on a specific frequency. <br>Part of the license application is a description of the owners system, and approval of the location of amplifier and receivers. </div>
<div><br>On a related note, there has been a history of problems receiving radio transmission from the Education and Employment Center in downtown Kankakee. The main reason for that problem is the current location of the receiver at college main campus. </div>
<div><br>To solve the problem, the receiver will be moved to the new, 100-foot-tall wind tower, allowing stronger reception and amplification to and from the portable radios used by the public safety officers and Physical Plant Departments.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC is in the process of applying for the new low-level frequency instead of waiting until next year. As soon as the license is approved, the college will upgrade its equipment and operations. This will allow for stronger radio communication, not only to the EDEC, but also to the north extension center in Bradley, and any future communications to the Iroquois County location. <br></div></font></div></div>
