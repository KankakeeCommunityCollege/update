<div><br />Beginning with the Fall 2013 semester, the Gerry Sikma Scholarship will be awarded to new or returning students enrolled in the KCC Agriculture Program.</div>
<div><br />“The KCC district is largely agricultural,” said Paul Carlson, associate dean of the KCC Business and Technology Division. “We are grateful for the vision and commitment of Shoup Manufacturing in establishing this award to help our students. The next generation which competes in the agricultural market must be highly skilled and business oriented. The commitment of Shoup Manufacturing will help us to gain more agricultural students and grow our program to meet the needs of this district.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The scholarship can be used for tuition, books, and fees. Applicants must have a 2.5 grade point average, live in KCC District 520, have a passion for agriculture, be hard working and have integrity. The scholarship is available to full- and part-time students. </div>

<div>Sikma began working for Shoup Manufacturing in 1988 as a warehouse worker. Over the years, his role with the company evolved, and he was a salesman for Shoup at the time of him death in 2008. He was also a grain farmer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>During the 20 years he worked for Shoup Manufacturing, Sikma was known for his dedication, passion, integrity and work ethic, said Ray Lovell, president of Shoup Manufacturing.</div>
