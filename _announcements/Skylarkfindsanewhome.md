<div>The campus looks a little different now that two sculptures have been installed on the grounds. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The large <em>Chicago Nike</em> stands with beauty and strength on the north lawn, and <em>Skylark</em>, our first KCC sculpture, has found a new home on the main drive. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hope the visual arts at KCC continue to reflect what is best in our campus community and am excited to see these pieces join <em>Meridian IX </em>and <em>Ibex</em> (outside court, north of reception area).</div>

<div><font color="#333399"><strong>The history of Skylark </strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div>According to the <em>Kankakee Sunday Journal </em>from Sept. 24 1978, <em>Skylark</em>, by Illinois' Alice Culbert, was the first sculpture to grace the college campus. It was purchased with funds from an Illinois Arts Council grant and the William Brandenburg Estate. </div>
<div><br />Created in 1977, The 8 1/2 foot, 800-pound corten steel sculpture now has a new home on a rise at the intersection of West Campus road and College Drive. <em>Skylark</em> was dedicated to the school’s first board of trustees on the college’s 10th anniversary. The members of the original board who attended that day were Merlin Karlock, Kenneth Seebach and John Rooney. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the dedication, Dr. Janet Heinicke, head of the visual arts program, described the piece:</div>
<div><br />“The skylark bird is an appropriate educational symbol. In literature, the skylark is referred to as a soaring bird with distinct, if not loud, voice. Chaucer called it the messenger of the day. Elizabeth Barrett Browning noted 'soaring music within the soaring lark.'</div>
<div><br />&quot;In light of education, such images conjure thoughts of lofty, bold, clear and fresh ideas that prosper in educational institutions of a democracy and give us insight into ourselves and our world. Skylark, distinguished by its curves that give an impression of infinity, and its contrasting earthborn foundation, connotes two characteristics of the public community college. One, a continuum of thought and intellect reminiscent of the skylark bird and, two, an institution whose roots are firmly embedded in the land and the people of the land known as the community college district.&quot;</div>
<div><br />Other notes from the day of dedication included this: “skylark--a bird of flight whose voice is a special cry and considered something beautiful. The sculpture’s abstract lines are infinite and open curves. Part of the educational process is not knowing where the end is--or it’s a never ending process. The result is not immediately visible. The sculpture’s bottom line is earth-bound. A public community college is very much related to its constituency. Urban and rural community are tied to the earth.&quot;</div>
