<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1CF669D622044B6380B16CF4700D546E"><p>​The KCC softball team has a record of 40 wins to go with six losses, and is seeking more wins as it enters the <a href="http://www.njcaa.org/sports_nationalChampionship.cfm?category=National%20Championship&amp;sid=48&amp;divid=2&amp;slid=14">National Tournament</a> this week. </p>
<p>The team claimed its 20th Region 4 Softball championship--and 17th in a row!--after defeating South Suburban College on Saturday, May 2. The Cavaliers were ranked No. 9 in the nation as of April 29. </p>
<p>Along with the title, two Cavaliers have been named NJCAA All-Americans. Mary Rankin, an infielder, is a first-team All-American and Meghan Gill, the designated player, is on the second-team.</p>
<p>The national tournament is in Clinton, Miss. from May 13-16.
