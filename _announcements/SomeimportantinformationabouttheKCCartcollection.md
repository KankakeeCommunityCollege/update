<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass271C9F9027404063B7CFBB9B7C17B39B"><p style="color:#00558d">​<span>Submitted by Jean Janssen, curator of the KCC art collection</span></p>
<p>In 1978, KCC President Dr. L.H. Horton and art professor Dr. Janet Heinicke received grant money from the Illinois Arts Council Permanent Collection Purchase Program. Since that time, KCC has been fortunate enough to acquire many pieces of art through other funding or donations, including two new outdoor sculptures and four new indoor pieces on the Riverfront Campus; as well as four sculptures at the South Extension Center in Watseka. </p>
<p>We now have approximately 300 pieces of artwork in our permanent collection.  </p>
<p>In the past two years, KCC has been restoring many of the two-dimensional artworks. Glass in fine art prints, including  artist-signed and numbered lithographs, silk screen/serigraphs, intaglio prints and water based media artwork such as water color and tempera, was replaced with UV plexi, which blocks out harmful sun and room lighting, and archival mat board which proactively traps and neutralizes pollutants and acid by-products that can damage artwork. Many artworks received new frames as well.</p>
<p>The artwork is being re-hung and you may see some in new locations. You  certainly may notice the difference in many works. </p>
<p>We need to take care of the artwork we have, so please be cautious when cleaning art surfaces. UV plexi should only be cleaned with a soft cloth and clear water, no window cleaning products should be used because it can scratch the plexi-glass.</p>
<p>Also, the entire collection is being cataloged in Microsoft Excel, so we always know where each artwork is located. If you have artwork in your office that you would like to have removed, please contact Jean Janssen or Kari Nugent. The rest of the artwork in the general area of the college is carefully located for aesthetic purposes. We hope you enjoy it!<br /></p>
