<p>The 110-foot KCC wind tower soon will do more than just power the campus. For a limited time, it will charge personal electronic devices, too. </p>
<p>The new program will be tried out on April 1 beginning at 4:01 p.m. All college employees are invited to bring their personal electronic devices to be charged using “wind tower power.” </p>
<p>“The most exciting part of this proposition is that we will hook directly into the wind tower out in the field,” said Bert Jacobson, dean of environmental and institutional sustainability. “I really hope someone brings an iPod with ‘Wind Beneath my Wings’ to play for everyone during the event. It would be OK if someone plays Bob Segar’s ‘Against the Wind.’ But, really, some of his songs are just nonsense.”</p>
<p>Forty-one highly qualified specialists have completely rewired the tower for this project. They started back in February, working in secret for about four minutes each day, Bert added.</p>
<p>There might be a crowd. </p>
<p>To make it a successful event, only those in line at 4:01 p.m. will be able to charge up. There will be a limit of 4 electronic devices per person. Power cords to charge items must be 4 foot, 1 inch long. Sharing cords will not be allowed. Also, to keep the line moving, there will be a limit of 4 minutes, 1 second per item being charged.</p>
<p>To participate, go to the wind tower, located on the south end of KCC’s main campus. Late-comers will be turned away (but may receive a hand-held fan as a souvenir).</p>
