<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass57651DCF5A074A9AA5A62B85A2D97436"><div>The 2013 Spring Intercultural Lecture Series featured two KCC professors. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In March, Prosper Hevi presented “Ghana: A Pioneering Example in Sub-Saharan African Development” to an audience of more than 30. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>About the presentation, one student commented, “This presentation was extremely enlightening. I was not aware that such a nice beautiful area existed in Africa and that people in Ghana live on the average norm as we do here in America.”</div>
<div><br />Another student said, “I was surprised to learn how modern Ghana is and the amount of power that comes to them from hydroelectric resources.”</div>
<div><br />“One of the biggest differences that I picked up on is the friendliness of the country,&quot; a third student said. &quot;The professor spoke of how one feels welcome wherever they go and a conversation can be held with a complete stranger; however, when you walk away you feel as if you knew each other. It seems that the people in Ghana appreciate life and take care of their country and each other. I was pleased to have attended the lecture.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In April, Sudipta Roy presented “India: The Many Facets of Development” to an audience of more than 40. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>“I found Professor Roy's presentation on India really interesting, including the fact that India has the 2nd biggest population in the world,&quot; a student said. &quot;Also, I learned the real definition of a third world country and that India is technologically advanced--most people have cell phones instead of land lines. I also learned that 80% of the people follow Hinduism and found interesting that it is the second largest country to speak English. Overall, I think this event was very interesting and wish KCC offered more events like this.” </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Intercultural Lecture Series was sponsored by KCC's Cultural Diversity Committee.</div>
