<div><br />Please encourage students to bring their books in.</div>
<div> <br />“We try to pay up to 50 percent of the purchase price of the book and this helps us to stock our shelves with used editions for the next semester,” said Jill Christy, Hammes Bookstore manager. “We would rather purchase from our own students than find used editions from wholesale companies.”</div>
<div></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">At buyback, students will need to have a photo ID with them and all CDs etc. that might have come with the textbook. Buyback hours are 8:30 a.m. - 7 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 8:30 a.m. - 4 p.m. on Friday, May 10 and Monday, May 13.</font></div>
