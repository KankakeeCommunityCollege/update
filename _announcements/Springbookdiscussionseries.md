<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass235A978A95E34A18B791B5408CF50471"><p>​The community is invited to join two Kankakee Community College professors in reading and discussing “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” by economist Thomas Piketty and “Coming Apart” by Charles Murray. <br /><br />The books were selected for their different perspectives on economics and culture. <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/inequality%20book%20discussion%20flier%20ver%202.pdf">View attached flier for information.</a><br /><br />“Since Piketty’s analysis comes from the left and focuses on economics, Charles Murray’s cultural analysis from the right seemed like a good counterpoint,” said Scott Kistler, one of the discussion leaders.<br /><br />“Discussions about inequality have become more frequent in recent years, it seems, and Murray’s look at marriage, families, and communities is also timely. Those interested in American history and culture and in the study of sociology may be interested. We want to both understand the arguments that Piketty and Murray are making and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses.”<br /><br />The discussions will be from 1-2 p.m. Wednesdays, Jan. 21 to April 29 in KCC Room L315. The first session will be Chapter 13 of “Capital in the Twenty-First Century.” The first part of the book was discussed in Fall 2014. <br /><br />Discussion of “Coming Apart” will begin on Feb. 18. Most weekly readings are less than 40 pages.<br /><br />The KCC professors leading the discussions are Steve DePasquale and Kistler. Kistler and DePasquale are both professors in KCC’s Humanities and Social Sciences Division.<br /><br />“These sessions will be devoted to a serious discussion of the ideas in these books. Students and the community are welcome to attend and ask questions,” Kistler said. “Those who wish to contribute to the discussion are asked to read the material ahead of time.”<br /><br />Both books are available in the KCC Hammes Bookstore. “Capital in the Twenty-First Century” is ISBN 9780521367011 and “Coming Apart” is ISBN 978-0-307-45343-3.<br /><br />For more information, contact Kistler at 815-802-8706, or email <a href="mailto:skistler@kcc.edu">skistler@kcc.edu</a>.</p>
