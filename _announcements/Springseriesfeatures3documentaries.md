<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassBE098191EA584C7DAE77DADA4FA14E66"><div><font size="2">Three documentary films will be shown during a free movie series this spring at KCC.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">First in the series is <em>Little Town of Bethlehem</em>, which focuses on three men of three different faiths working for nonviolent resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It will be shown at 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. Wednesday, March 23 in KCC’s auditorium.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">EthnoGraphic Media, which produced the film, says &quot;it shares the gripping story of how three men born into the cycle of violence have chosen to risk everything to bring peace to their homelands. Sami and Ahmad are Palestinians, one is a Christian, the other a Muslim; and Yonatan is an Israeli Jew. Independently they find inspiration through the example of Martin Luther King Jr.’s and Mahatma Gandhi’s sacrificial commitment to equality. At great personal cost they have joined together in a heroic and dangerous cause.&quot;</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“Many of us know Israel and the Palestinian territories mainly through news coverage of conflict and a peace process that always seems to fail,” said Scott Kistler, Humanities and Social Sciences professor. “This film offers an opportunity to get to know the lives of three people who live there and are working for peace.”</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">March 23 also is KCC’s annual Friendship Day celebration of cultural diversity. Friendship Day activities will be 10:30 a.m. - 1 p.m. The event is free.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The second film in the documentary film series is <em>Bonhoeffer</em>, which will be shown at 6 p.m. Thursday, April 7 in KCC’s auditorium.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The film tells the story of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German theologian who offered one of the first clear voices of resistance to Adolf Hitler. According to Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, “The film, shot on location in Germany and the United States, features interviews with family members, friends, students and associates who knew Bonhoeffer personally--including, the last interview given by Bonhoeffer's closest friend and biographer, Eberhard Bethge.”</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The third film in the series is <em>Waiting for Superman</em>. It will be shown at 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. Wednesday, April 27 in KCC’s auditorium. Directed and co-written by Davis Guggenheim, the 2010 documentary explores the state of public education in the U.S. and how it is affecting our children. </font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">A plot summary from the Sundance Film Festival states: “As he follows a handful of promising kids through a system that inhibits, rather than encourages, academic growth, Guggenheim undertakes an exhaustive review of public education, surveying ‘drop-out factories’ and ‘academic sinkholes,’ methodically dissecting the system and its seemingly intractable problems.”</font></div>
