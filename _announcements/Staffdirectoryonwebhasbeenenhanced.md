<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass9B01190D493A4958A2CBB725505F36F2"><p>​KCC's staff directory has undergone a transformation to improve both the organization of information and its accuracy.</p>
<p>There is a staff directory link at the bottom of all KCC web pages.</p>
<p>The new directory has a search field that can find people whether you enter a name, department or position. It also uses &quot;modal windows&quot; so when a name is chosen, the information pops open in a new window without really leaving the page.</p>
<p>The information in the directory is being maintained by the Human Resources Office. This change will assure the information is more up-to-date than in the past.</p></div></div>
