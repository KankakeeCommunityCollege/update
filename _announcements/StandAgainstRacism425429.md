<div><br>    Students, staff, faculty and members of the community can visit the main reception desk to make a resolution against racism, to sign the college's registry, and to receive an orange and white &quot;KCC Stands Against Racism&quot; rubber wristband. Stand Against Racism T-shirts also will be available for purchase at the main reception desk.</div>
<div><br>    On Friday, April 29, KCC will host a &quot;Commitment Walk&quot; from 9 a.m. - 3 p.m. on the south courtyard. Participants will be invited to walk through an archway/trellis symbolizing an individual's pledge to work toward a racism-free society. At 10:55 a.m. April 29, the college will observe a minute of silence and observance.</div>
<div><br>    &quot;KCC is proud to make its own 'stand,'&quot; said Oshunda Carpenter Williams, a member of the Cultural Diversity Committee, which is organizing the event at KCC. </div>
<div><br>    Stand Against Racism is a national movement of the YWCA to bring together like-minded organizations that share in their vision of eliminating racism and celebrating the richness of diversity. </div>
<div><br>    &quot;Racism and discrimination hurts everyone and has had a profound effect on children and adults, our communities and our institutions,&quot; said YWCA materials. &quot;Racism can take many different forms, (including) but not limited to discrimination; personal attacks of any kind, including violence; written or verbal threats or insults; damage to property, including graffiti.&quot;</div>
<div><br>    For more information about the event at KCC, contact Oshunda at 815-802-8513.  <br></div></font></div></div>
