<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Submitted by Linda Guinn, KKCAA president and legislative chair</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif';font-size:11pt">On March 6, 2014, the State Universities Annuitants Association (SUAA) filed a lawsuit challenging Senate Bill 1 (SB1) on behalf of SURS members. </span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif';font-size:11pt">SUAA’s lawsuit is unique among the approximately six lawsuits that have been filed because it represents <b style="">only SURS members</b> and because it provides <b style="">three</b> <b style="">different</b> <b style="">arguments</b> related specifically to the SURS Retirement System for striking down SB1: <span style=""> </span>(1) the pension protection clause, (2) the taking of personal property without compensation, and (3) the contracts clause in the Illinois Constitution.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif';font-size:11pt">The State Universities Retirement System – SURS – is the only state retirement system that has a Self-Managed Plan, a Portable Plan, and a Traditional Plan. Consequently, SUAA’s lawsuit is very specific in order to protect SURS members in all three plans. SB1 causes significant cuts in SURS pensions.</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif';font-size:11pt">If you are not a SUAA member, please join today! The more members SUAA has, the more seriously SUAA is taken by legislators! Every additional member <b style="">increases your voice</b> in Springfield!</span></p>
<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt" class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif';font-size:11pt">Contact any SUAA member for more information or go to <a href="http://www.suaa.org/"><font color="#0000ff">http://www.suaa.org</font></a> and click on “<b style="">Join now”</b>.
