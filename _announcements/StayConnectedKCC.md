<div>   Like growth of social media use across the country, KCC also offers a number of social media experiences to keep students, employees and the community connected to campus. </div>
<div>   Since the launch of KCC’s Facebook page in August 2009, the college now has more than 2,500 fans.  Through Facebook, there are daily messages regarding events, announcements, photos, sports scores and other KCC happenings. Several departments and programs also have worked with the college’s social media team to establish Facebook pages. Through Facebook, programs, departments &amp; organizations such as Continuing Education and Career Services, Student Life, HVAC program and the Alumni Association are in touch with their audiences. They have a consistent branded look and are linked to the college’s primary Facebook page.</div>
<div>   “Facebook has allowed us to add an additional way to communicate messages and, unlike traditional print media, create conversations with our constituents,” said Nancy Schunke who coordinates the college’s social media efforts. “This allows us to respond to comments, field questions and seek input from those who utilize or have an interest in our services almost instantaneously.” </div>
<div>   Information &amp; announcements on KCC’s website &amp; Facebook page also are posted to @kccedu on Twitter. </div>
<div>   In the realm of moving pictures, KCC’s YouTube channel, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/kankakeecommcollege">http://www.youtube.com/kankakeecommcollege</a>, has videos posted by faculty and staff. The videos are linked to the Facebook page and Twitter account as appropriate.</div>
<div>   KCC is also continuing to expand its blogs page. Visit <a href="/blogs">www.kcc.edu/blogs</a> to read posts, make comments or initiate conversations. Four staff members and one student are hosting blogs: &quot;Let's get to work,&quot; by Emily Skelly, coordinator of career development; &quot;The Green Academic,&quot; by Scott Stewart, director of horticulture and agriculture programs; &quot;Motivation ... Let's do this!&quot; by Nancy Schunke, marketing coordinator; “It’s more than books,” by Lindsey Fritz, student life coordinator and &quot;The Student Front,&quot; by Ryan Guertin, business student. </div>
<div>   “The college expanded into blogging as a new method to engage our online community,&quot; said Nancy. “Since the kick-off of the KCC’s blogs page on Feb. 9, 2011 there have been over 8,500 visits to the blogs.”</div>
<div>   KCC’s newest addition is its mobile website at <a href="/">www.kcc.edu</a> This allows students to access campus information, webmail, KCConnect , Angel and other announcements on the go. Since the launch of this site in August 2011there have been over 14,100 visits to the site. </div>
