<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassF39B185BCA4A4ED8AFE39A3205478C89"><p>​Faculty and staff are invited to attend a strategic planning forum focused on enrollment on Wednesday, Sept. 6 from 3-5 p.m. in the Auditorium. Calendar appointments will be sent.</p>
<p>Outcomes from the current strategic plan and enrollment efforts will be presented. The audience also will be asked to help generate ideas for future enrollment activities. </p>
<p>“Our current institutional strategic plan concludes in 2018, and enrollment is the biggest strategic challenge right now,” said Dr. Michael Boyd, vice president for Instructional and Student Success. “Instead of working on another long-range strategic plan, let’s design an alternate strategy, with an intense and specific action plan, aimed at increasing enrollment.” </p>
<p>The Strategic Planning Oversight Committee (SPOC) is hosting the forum. Afterward, SPOC will use the ideas generated to determine future strategic priorities. Action teams will be organized for each of the strategic priorities. The teams will develop measurements, action steps, and accountability plans to ensure progress and results.</p>
<p>“We all have an important role to play as we face challenges related to current enrollment trends,” said Mike. “We hope you’ll join us at the forum.”<br /></p></div></div>
