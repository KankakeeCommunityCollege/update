Please encourage student participation in the free and diverse activities available. Events are posted on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/KankakeeCommunityCollegeStudentLife?ref=bookmarks">Student Life Facebook page</a> and <a href="/students/studentlife/Pages/Kankakee%20Community%20College.aspx">Student Life online calendar</a>.<br /> <br />One great way for students to learn about campus involvement is by attending Club Rush. <br /><br />The Office of Student Life will be hosting this event on Tuesday, Sept. 8 and Wednesday, Sept. 9 in KCC’s front courtyard from 11 am – 2 pm. <br /><br />Club Rush is an event where students can learn about KCC resources and campus clubs and organizations. <br /><br />DJ Berger will be supplying music both days. <br /><br />Staff are invited to attend Dave DiNasa’s Traveling World of Reptiles Show at 12:15 on Tuesday, Sept. 8. <br /><br />Please be informed that staff and faculty who wish to enjoy refreshments on these days will be charged a small fee to help offset cost. There will be a $2 fee charged for shake-ups on Tuesday, Sept. 8 and a $1 fee charged for hot dogs on Wednesday, Sept. 9.<br /> <br />If you have any questions about these events or Student Life, please contact Laura Gardner, coordinator of student life and development, at 815-802-8628 or <a href="mailto:lgardner@kcc.edu">lgardner@kcc.edu</a>. </p>
