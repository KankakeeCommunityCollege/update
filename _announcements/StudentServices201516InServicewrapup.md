<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1BD2DC29F72343AEADF1EDE402E7D79D"><p style="color:blue">Submitted by Julia Waskosky, dean of student development</p>
<p>I would like to express my gratitude to Karen Bayston, Kendra Souligne, Cindy Hebert, Steve Makepeace, Eddie Anderson, Kazia Boseo, Keisha Smith and Sharon Hoogstraat for serving on the Student Services Department planning committee. </p>
<p>With our focus on making meaningful connections that lead to student completion and the college’s strategic priorities, your insight and ideas ensured a balance of information sharing, goal setting, and active participation for our staff.</p>
<p>A special thank you is in order for Meredith Purcell, Kim Harpin and David Hermann who facilitated the day in my absence. Without your help, the day would not have been a success.</p>
<p>Our guest speaker, Tracey Morris, vice president for student development at Illinois Central College, gave us a fresh perspective on making connections with students. This professional development piece challenged us to approach our work with a clear purpose centered on developing relationships with students so they experience a meaningful connection to KCC.</p>
<p>The success of the department’s annual in-service was a direct result of the commitment and time of these individuals. Thank you.</p>
