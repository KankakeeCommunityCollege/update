<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassF85FAD3C8E55459FBD775E409FC5E58A"><p>A Student Services staff in-service was held Thursday, Feb. 2.</p>
<p>&quot;I would like to express my gratitude to Laura Gardner, Sam Enz, Kendra Souligne, Nancy Schunke and Sharon Hoogstraat for serving on the department’s planning committee,&quot; said Julia Waskosky, dean of student development. &quot;The insight and ideas offered by the committee ensured a balance of information, goal setting, and active participation for our staff.</p>
<p>&quot;Our guest speaker, <a href="http://www.impactinsights.com/">Kathie Topel</a> gave us a fresh perspective on the power of stress, its impact on employee morale and the things we can do to manage it. Kathie also facilitated the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis">SWOT analyses</a> and the results informed the 2017-18 goals that each team drafted. This professional development piece challenged us to approach our work and goals for the upcoming year with a clear purpose and strategies to successfully embrace the future.</p>
<p>&quot;The success of the department’s annual in-service was a direct result of the commitment and time of these individuals. Thank you.&quot;<br /></p></div></div>
