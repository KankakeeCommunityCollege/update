<div>Beginning in January, students will receive a limit of 500 pages per semester for printing. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The goals are to educate students about the cost of printing, reduce print waste and conserve energy as part of the college’s ongoing commitment to sustainability.</div>
<div><br />Faculty and staff printing will not be affected, and at this time there is no plan to charge students for printing.</div>
<div><br />To track usage, each student will begin the semester with a $25 credit. The student’s available balance will be reduced by 5 cents per page for black and 10 cents per page for color printing. <br />Students who exceed the $25 limit can visit the Information Technology Services Help Desk in Room L364 to have the limit increased.</div>
<div><br />Students can monitor their print usage through a desktop application installed on KCC computers. Every time students log in to their network account on campus they will automatically be linked to the app that shows their remaining print balance.</div>
