<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC62DAFA67B054DD591E36391B1B36E1C"><div><strong><font color="#000080">Program is good for the environment</font></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since the start of the Spring 2013 semester, KCC implemented a student printing quota of 500 pages per student, per semester. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When comparing Spring 2013 and Fall 2013, we’ve realized a considerable reduction in the costs/energy related to student printing:</div>
<div>- The total number of pages printed was reduced by 40%, a savings of $11,484.35.</div>
<div>- The total number of print jobs was reduced by 30%, which effectively increases the life of our printers and reduces the amount of energy used to print.</div>
<div>- A total of 2,728 students printed during Spring 2013. Of them, only 66 (2%) requested to have increased quotas. Of the 66 students requesting quota increases, approximately 44% (29 students) required more than one increase.</div>
<div>- More than 80% of the pages printed were double-sided vs. single-sided for Spring 2013.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“This program has had a significant impact on controlling student printing costs without negatively impacting the student body,” said Michael O’Connor, director of information technology services. “Just the mere fact that this project paid for itself within the first six weeks of implementation is a significant win.”<br /></div>
