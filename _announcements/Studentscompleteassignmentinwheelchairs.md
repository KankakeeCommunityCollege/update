<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassECB69B6FB14340B3833669CA760F59C7"><div>Faculty of the Physical Therapist Assistant program would like to inform other faculty and staff about assignments where students will take part in experiences around the main campus.</div>
<div><br />To gain a greater understanding of what their patients and others with physical disabilities may experience, PTA students will utilize wheelchairs around campus. During the assignment, students will use the elevators and maneuver around the library, cafeteria and bookstore. <br /></div>
<div>The PTA students have been instructed to NOT let this assignment, which is required for their PTA class, interfere with any other responsibility or class they have. They may attend class in a wheelchair; however, it should not prevent them from participating fully.<br /></div>
<div>The students will be completing this activity over the next two weeks.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you for your cooperation in enhancing student learning.<br /></div>
<div>Please contact Jennifer Blanchette, <a href="mailto:jsblanchette@kcc.edu">jsblanchette@kcc.edu</a>, with any questions.</div>
