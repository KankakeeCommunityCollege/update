<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1ABDF0972E7B4E818C700C8E152DD29A"><p>​Students in the Agriculture-Horticulture program at KCC are truly digging the experience. <br /><br /><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/agrihort-landscaping.jpg" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />With a hands-on approach to teaching agriculture and horticulture, students are learning valuable job skills.<span style="color:#b10069"> <span style="color:#595959">From traditional growing methods to hydroponic and aquaponic systems, </span></span><span style="color:#595959">the </span>Agri/Hort Technology program broadens student experiences while tailoring it to their interests. </p>
<p>KCC offers two associate degrees and 13 certificate options. The Agri-Hort Technology Associate in Applied Science degree has four specializations--Horticulture, Manufacturing Technology, Production and Business. Each specialization has certificates available. The Agriculture transfer degree provides the first two years of a bachelor's degree.<br /><br />“We have four brand new pathways to earning a degree,” said Katelynn Ohrt, director of the Agri-Hort Technology program at KCC. “For those who decide to pursue a certificate, they are stackable and credit hours can carry over to earn a degree.”</p>
<p>KCC partnered with an advisory committee of leaders from local agriculture and business, along with students, to design and revise the curriculum. </p>
<p>Throughout the program there is classroom, laboratory, greenhouse and practical experience in the field.</p>
<p><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/agrihort-grafting.jpg" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />Lyn Nitz-Mercaeant of Kankakee is a sophomore in the program. Already  a master gardener with the University of Illinois Extension, she originally enrolled in a certificate program to brush up on her skills. The flexibility to keep adding on to the program will culminate in a degree from KCC this spring. She plans transfer to a university this fall to pursue a bachelor’s degree. </p>
<p>“Growing up in a farming family, I’ve always enjoyed agriculture and gardening,” said Nitz-Mercaeant. “I raised my family, and it was time to do something for mom. I was pleased by all the options KCC had to offer.”</p>
<p>Nitz-Mercaeant cites all the hands-on opportunities and lab-based curriculum for making the program her own. “I didn’t know what to expect when I started this program, but I’ve learned so much,” said Nitz-Mercaeant. “I’ve had so many unique, hands-on opportunities.”</p>
<p>One opportunity was setting up aquaponic tanks in the greenhouse, including a closed-system tank where students raise tilapia. Over the top of the tank sits foam where herbs and vegetables grow. The plants’ roots are immersed in the tank and help to nourish and filter the water for the tilapia. </p>
<p>The other 500-gallon tank is an open system tank hooked up to a bed with a flood and drainage system. The goldfish in it help filter and fertilize the water for the plants (herbs, vegetable and strawberries) growing above. </p>
<p>“Getting the aquaponic tanks up and running and producing food was a huge milestone that we are all proud of,” said Ohrt. “Because the class sizes are small, everyone has an opportunity for in setting up and maintaining the tanks.”<br /><br /><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/agrihort-coldframe.jpg" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />To support a farm-to-table initiative and sustainable practices, Ohrt hopes their efforts can provide food for a salad bar on campus. </p>
<p>“Currently, we grow enough food for the students in the program to take home what we produce,” said Ohrt. “Soon, we hope to offer our harvest to the college’s cafeteria. It’s an exciting, in-the-works project.”</p>
<p>Ohrt also is teaching the students about using technology such as drones, which are flying devices that carry cameras and can be navigated remotely by smartphones or controllers. Farmers are using drones for mapping to increase yields and reduce crop damage.</p>
<p>“Mapping the fields provide farmers with a blueprint of their crops, and drones are helping to revolutionize the industry,” said Ohrt. “We hope to purchase and incorporate a drone into our curriculum as soon as this spring.”</p>
<p>Another piece of technology Ohrt has recently purchased is handheld GPS units for making better decisions to plant, map, sample, scout, and harvest fields.</p>
<p>Many of the new technologies that Ohrt plans and is currently using are a result of collaboration and suggestions by the advisory committee. </p>
<p>“Our relationship with KCC has allowed us to suggest ways their program can benefit the industry,” said Matt Perreault, sales/research and development manager at Shoup Manufacturing in Kankakee, a member of  the advisory committee. “KCC is an affordable way for those who want to get hands-on experience and learn best practices to get a jump start on their career.”</p>
<p><img src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/agrihort-pruning.jpg" alt="" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />Shoup markets and distributes replacement parts for farm equipment. Shoup approached KCC about internship opportunities available for students, and the relationship between the two entities blossomed.</p>
<p>In addition providing internship opportunities, Shoup also has supported the Gerry Sikma Scholarship for Agri-Hort Technology students. Two full scholarships, including tuition and books, are offered. </p>
<p>&quot;Katelynn invited us to the scholarship banquet so we could meet the recipients,” said Perrault. “It was rewarding to meet the students and learn how our support helped them achieve their goal of getting education in the field.”</p>
<p>Six other scholarships offered by the KCC Foundation are for students in agriculture and horticulture-related programs. They are the Central Illinois Green Club Agriculture/ Horticulture Scholarship, Dennis and Georgia Hess Scholarship, Dorothy and Walter Franklin Scholarship, Kankakee Kultivators Horticulture Scholarship, Kankakee Valley Garden Club Horticulture Scholarship, The Olde Time Farm Show Scholarship, and the Robert Worth Family Horticulture Scholarship. </p>
<p>All KCC students who have an interest in the field are invited to join the Horticulture Club, which sponsors farmers’ markets and organizes a community garden for KCC students and staff. “We also sponsor an annual trip to the Chicago Flower and Garden Show,” Ohrt said.</p>
