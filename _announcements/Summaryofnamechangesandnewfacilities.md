<div> </div>
<div>In a period of less than 10 months--from June 1, 2013 to March 15, 2014--KCC is opening or changing the names of four college facilities.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is a brief overview of those changes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>KCC Harold and Jean Miner South Extension Center</strong> -- 1488 E. Walnut St., Watseka IL 60970. <br />Opened: June 2013. <br />Brief history: Replaced the Iroquois County Satellite Center, which was at a different location.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Harold and Jean Miner Memorial Library</strong> -- Located on the Riverfront Campus at 100 College Drive, Kankakee. <br />Dedication: Oct. 15, 2013.<br />Brief history: Formerly called the Learning Resource Center. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Manufacturing and Industrial Technology Center</strong> -- 2580 S. Route 45/52, Kankakee IL 60901<br />Scheduled opening: January 2014<br />Brief history: Remodeled location for welding, machine tool technology and millwright classes. Other programs may offer programs there as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>North Extension Center</strong> -- 450 N. Kinzie Ave., Bradley IL 60901<br />Scheduled opening: March 2014<br />Brief history: New location will offer KCC credit classes, adult education classes, continuing education classes and the Workforce Investment Act offices. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Two locations now bear the name of Harold and Jean Miner. They were renamed following gifts from the Miner Charitable Foundation, established by the Miners. The Miners were lifelong farmers who lived in rural Watseka and who were dedicated community supporters who volunteered in agriculture, music and their church. The Foundation carries out the wishes of the Miners through charitable gifts and college scholarships for Iroquois County high school graduates. Many of the recipients study in areas such as agriculture, library science, music, public service and safety, where the Miners had their strongest interests.</div>
<div><br />Also note, Riverfront Campus is now being used when a distinction is needed between the campus at 100 College Drive in Kankakee and other locations. As always, Kankakee Community College, 100 College Drive, is correct as the main address for KCC.<br /></div>
