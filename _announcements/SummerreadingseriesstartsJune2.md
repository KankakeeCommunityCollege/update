<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass9A75BAA31C7F4913B0770234006FBBF3"><p>​Two KCC professors will hold a book discussion series on the book <em><a href="http://isibooks.org/the-quest-for-community.html">The Quest for Community</a></em> by Robert Nisbet on Tuesdays, June 2 - July 21.</p>
<p><img alt="The Quest for Community" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/The_Quest_for_Community.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />The reading for each week is less than 50 pages. Each session will be 11a.m.-12 p.m. in Room L315. The schedule is:<br />June 2 - Intro and Prefaces; Chapter 1<br />June 9 - Chapters 2 &amp; 3<br />June 16: - Ch. 4 &amp; 5<br />June 23 - Ch. 6 &amp; 7<br />June 30 - Ch. 8<br />July 7 - Ch. 9 &amp; 10<br />July 14 - Ch. 11 &amp; Conclusion<br />July 21 - Critical Essays</p>
<p>&quot;Nisbet argues for the importance of nonpolitical institutions in society,&quot; said Professor Scott Kistler, one of the discussion leaders. The other discussion leader is Professor Steve DePasquale.</p>
<p>&quot;We will be looking at John Rawls' <em>A Theory of Justice</em>, a classic of modern liberalism; and libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick's <em>State, Anarchy, and Community</em> in the fall and spring,&quot; Scott said. &quot;Those books have a more individualistic approach to politics and society&quot; compared to <em><a href="http://isibooks.org/the-quest-for-community.html">The Quest for Community</a></em>.</p>
<p>The book can be purchased online and is also available through interlibrary loan. The ISBN is 9781935191506 and one website where it is available is <a href="http://isibooks.org/the-quest-for-community.html.">http://isibooks.org/the-quest-for-community.html.</a></p>
<p>Sessions will be devoted to a serious discussion of the book. All are welcome to attend and ask questions. To contribute to the discussion, please read the material ahead of time. </p>
