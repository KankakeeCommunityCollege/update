<div><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif';color:black;font-size:10pt">Supportive Staff employees are asked to keep in mind the option for resolving concerns through the use of &quot;advocates.&quot;<br></span></div>
<div><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif';color:black;font-size:10pt">The two designated advocates are Andy Panici, who works at the Education and Employment Center in downtown Kankakee, and Jane Clark, who works in the human resources office. </span></div><span style="font-family:'Arial','sans-serif';color:black;font-size:10pt">
<div><br>Jane and Andy offer a comfortable environment for employees to &quot;air out&quot; any problems they may be experiencing.</div>
<div><br>&quot;We offer them a chance to come in and discuss what's on their mind,&quot; Jane said.</div>
<div><br>Advocates have been available since July 2003 and the addition of this option has been very beneficial. To take part in the process, supportive staff members are asked to follow the procedures listed below:</div>
<div><br>First, contact either Jane or Andy to communicate any problem or concern.</div>
<div><br>Second, make an appointment to meet with either or both of the advocates at a neutral location.</div>
<div><br>Third, resolution of the problem or concern will be attempted at the meeting.</div>
<div><br>Fourth, if a resolution is not achieved, further meetings may occur including other employees, with the staff member's permission.<br></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Things to note about this process:<br>    - All identities and issues will be held in strict confidence.<br>    - No personal information will be documented.<br>    - Advocates may seek advice from the director of human resources, the vice president for finance and administration or the college president with the staff member's permission.<br>     - Not all issues can be resolved through this process.<br>     - All other currently existing options for resolution of problems and concerns are still available to the employee (see section 14.0 of the Personnel Policy and Procedures Handbook, &quot;Complaints and Appeals&quot;).<br></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Questions regarding this process may be addressed by email or phone to Jane, <a href="mailto:jclark@kcc.edu" shape=rect target="_blank">jclark@kcc.edu</a>, 815-802-8146 or to Andy, <a href="mailto:apanici@kcc.edu" shape=rect target="_blank">apanici@kcc.edu</a>, 815-802-8968.</span></div></div></div>
