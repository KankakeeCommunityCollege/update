<div>Faculty and staff support of the employee giving grew again last week.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As of Sept. 27, employee contributions totaled $16,335.05. Thank you all for your support! If you have not yet contributed, it isn’t too late. Open enrollment for the campaign continues through Oct. 13, and employees can contribute to the campaign through June 30, 2014. </div>
<div><br />Participation for the 2013 campaign is now at 42%. The campaign goal is 100% participation. As an incentive for participation, all departments who reach 100% participation by Oct. 13 will be entered into a raffle to win a gift basket packed with treats, donated by Jane Clark.</div>
<div><br />In the weeks ahead, members of the employee giving committee will be available in the College Center during lunchtime to answer questions and accept employee giving contributions. Jamie Lockwood from the Business Office and Deanna Thompson from the Office of Financial Aid will be available on Oct. 3 from 11 a.m. - 1 p.m. in the College Center to assist with enrollment and answer questions. <br /></div>
<div>To make a contribution, employees may visit the <a href="/Foundation/giving/eg/Pages/default.aspx">Employee Giving web page</a>, or contact the Foundation at 815-802-8252.</div>
