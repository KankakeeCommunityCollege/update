<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass4AC2C2785FDB4881A4A2216D6EE2574A">
<div><br />It has recently been suggested that we publish a KCC Employee Cookbook.</div>
<div><br />We know that there are many wonderful cooks and bakers, as proven by the “treat days” that many departments engage in for birthdays and other special occasions. In order to pull this off, we need your help.</div>
<div><br />Please submit your favorite recipes to Janet Fager in Human Resources by Oct. 24. </div>
<div><br />Submissions should be Word documents including the following elements: Title of recipe, person submitting the recipe, list of ingredients and measurements, and instructions.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The goal is to have the cookbook available for purchase at the annual Homespun Holiday Hoopla on Thursday, Nov. 21. They will make a wonderful gift for that hard-to-buy-for person, to pass on recipes to your kids or grandkids, or just as a treat for yourself.  <br /></div>
<div>Proceeds from the sale of the books will go toward KCC’s United Way campaign. If you would like to volunteer to help with this endeavor or have any questions, please contact Janet Fager at 815-802-8124.</div>
