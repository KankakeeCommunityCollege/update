<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass9EF4664B8C6D454F884E50BCD82B1068"><p>​Teaching Squares is an exciting new professional development opportunity!</p>
<p>This voluntary program attempts to improve teaching and build community through a structured, non-evaluative process of classroom visits and shared reflection. Your Teaching Squares experience offers you the opportunity to improve your own teaching by visiting your Square Partners in an actual classroom situation. There is also an online option to learn about Square Partners online teaching strategies and course design through a guided tour and discussion with each of your Square Partners.</p>
<p>A Teaching Square consists of four faculty participants (preferrably from different disciplines) who:</p>
<p>• Visit at least one class taught by each Square Partner (three class visits); or, for the online version, receive a guided tour. <br />• Reflect on each class experience and methods demonstrated.<br />• Share reflections with Square Partners<br />• Share Square observations with Project participants as a whole</p>
<p>The Teaching Squares program will require about one hour per week for seven weeks. The kickoff will be Tuesday, Feb. 17. Sign up today by emailing <a href="mailto:ckeigher@kcc.edu">ckeigher@kcc.edu</a>. </p>
