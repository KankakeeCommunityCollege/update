<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass0165FCE9393E47978EBDC790284C7A40><div> </div>
<div>From: Ellen Skelly, coordinator of publications</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC's faculty and staff always come through when we ask for model students--and it is that time again.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The marketing office is looking for students to highlight in advertising and upcoming publications.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We hope to choose five to 10 students/graduates. We are looking for people from various backgrounds. They should be good students, but they don't have to be &quot;top of the class.&quot; </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are interested in telling each person's story. We would like for help from faculty and staff by sharing which students have shown themselves to be open, honest and hardworking.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The only other guideline is that we will be interviewing the students. So, they need to be people who will talk about themselves. Shy people who can be drawn out are fine, but &quot;yes/no&quot; and monotone answers would not work out well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The stories we gather have several places where they might be used: website, advertising, voice-overs in radio ads, and the college viewbook.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please make your recommendations by e-mail or phone to Ellen Skelly (<a href="mailto:eskelly@kcc.edu">eskelly@kcc.edu</a>; 815-802-8279) or Kari Sargeant (<a href="mailto:ksargeant@kcc.edu">ksargeant@kcc.edu</a>; 815-802-8256). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If possible, include a sentence or two about why you are making the recommendation. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you very much.</div>
