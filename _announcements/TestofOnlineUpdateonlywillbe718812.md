<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass2F4E315F01F54BE7B0F4238577F1E8BA>
<div><font size=2>For the month between July 18 and Aug. 12, Update will be provided online only.<br>    </font></div>
<div><font size=2>A weekly email will be sent to all employee groups, and to the retirees and friends of the college who have requested to receive Update.<br>    </font></div>
<div><font size=2>Instead of full articles, it will list some of the article headlines which can be found online. Readers can click on the headlines and read the full articles online at </font><a href="/update"><font size=2>www.kcc.edu/update</font></a><font size=2>. The email also will have links which are found in the familiar Update e-newsletter format (such as candid comments, Food Service menu and evening administrator). Those same links will always be available on the Online Update page.<br>    </font></div>
<div><font size=2>The hope is that everyone can get more used to looking online for information. Comments on Update in general or the Online Update are welcome. Submit comments to </font><a href="mailto:update@kcc.edu"><font size=2>update@kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2> or </font><a href="mailto:ksargeant@kcc.edu"><font size=2>ksargeant@kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2>.<br>    </font></div>
<div><font size=2>Here are a few things to remember about Online Update:<br>   •  Articles and information are added to the online version as they arrive. You don't have to wait until Monday morning. Requests will be posted to Online Update within one business day. Items received before 1 p.m. will be posted before the beginning of the next business day.<br>    •  There is an option to see only the articles added within the last week and events which occur within the next seven days. To see them, choose the &quot;Recent Updates&quot; link on the left.<br>    •  To see the archives, choose the &quot;Update Archives&quot; link on the left. If you can't find an article, email </font><a href="mailto:update@kcc.edu"><font size=2>update@kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2> and the Update editorial staff will try to help. <br>    •  Previous feedback included requests for a better search mechanism. It is in the works, but may take some time to work correctly. So, if you can't find something, email </font><a href="mailto:update@kcc.edu"><font size=2>update@kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2> and the Update editorial staff will try to help. <br>    •  You are encouraged to subscribe to the RSS feeds for Update Announcements and Update Events (see subscription steps below). After subscribing to the Update RSS feeds, new items to the events and announcements will automatically be sent to your RSS feed folders in Outlook. To receive events and announcements, you must sign up for both the Update - Events RSS Feed and the Update - Announcements RSS Feed.</font></div>
<div><font size=2></font> </div>
<div><font size=2>How to subscribe to RSS feeds using the Internet Explorer browser<br>    <br>    1. Visit </font><a href="/update/"><font size=2>www.kcc.edu/update/</font></a><font size=2>.<br>    2. Scroll down until you see the <img alt="RSS feed" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/RSS_feed.JPG"> symbol (on the right side of the screen, in the same blue screened bar with the Announcements and Events headings). Click on it.<br>    3. Click &quot;subscribe to this feed&quot; (see figure 1) to have the feed delivered to your Outlook RSS feeds folder. <br> <br> Figure 1.</font></div>
