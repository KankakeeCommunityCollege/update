<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassF0914BF9793149ED9589CA2513449565"><p>​The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.<br /> <br />Thanks-a-Grams have two components:<br />First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.<br /> <br />Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.<br /> <br /><span style="color:blue">Thanks-a-gram </span> <br /><br />TO: All Kankakee Community College Faculty and Staff<br />FROM: Oshunda Carpenter Williams<br />RE: Thanks for all you do for KCC students and the community<br /><br />I want to make sure I do not leave without expressing how thankful I am that I was afforded an opportunity to work with people who are passionate about helping students. Sometimes it really shows that we know why we come to work everyday; the students. I especially want to thank all of the people here who helped me to do my job well so that I could have a positive impact on students at KCC. I will never forget any of you. I sincerely appreciate all of you. I will be in touch. Keep doing what you do and remember, why you do it.<br /><br />THANK YOU:  ADMISSIONS/REGISTRATION/RECORDS STAFF!! </p>
