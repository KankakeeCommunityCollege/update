<div><font size="2">The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.<br /> <br />Thanks-a-Grams have two components:<br />First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.<br /> <br />Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.<br /> <br /><font color="#0000ff">Thanks-a-gram</font> </font></div>

<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Wanted to send out a big thank you to Annie and Jordan for their constant dedication to their positions as student workers in PPD.  They both know their job well and as work comes in they handle it appropriately with little direction.  They often ask if there is anything more that needs to be done or if I need any help with any special projects. They will even come in between classes when they are not scheduled</font> to work, just to check out the work load and will not hesitate to jump right in when needed.  <br />                </div>
<div>Thanks - you guys rock !</div>
