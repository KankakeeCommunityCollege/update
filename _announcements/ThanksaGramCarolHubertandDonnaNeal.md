<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassB668322ABF994468AD9C04324E5817F3"><p>â€‹The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other. </p>
<p>Thanks-a-Grams have two components:</p>
<p>First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the Human Resources Department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in <em>Update</em> and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>
<p style="color:darkblue">Thanks-a-gram</p>
