<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass9B569E4DC33C4833B7AC8FD9D4CDD5D1"><div><font size="2">The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.<br /> <br />Thanks-a-Grams have two components:<br />First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.<br /> <br />Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.<br /> <br /><font color="#0000ff">Thanks-a-gram</font> </font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">TO: Chris Schilling<br />FROM: Jessica Corbus<br />RE:My &quot;Outlook&quot; is much brighter!</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Chris,</font></div>
<div><font size="2">Thank you for the time you spent problem solving the issues with my desktop. Your knowledge of the systems is clearly evident, and your critical thinking ability is exceptional. Thanks to you, my &quot;Outlook&quot; is much brighter!</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">It was fun to watch how you worked through the issue to first try option one and then continue through the options until the problem was solved. Not only did you solve the problem and fix the computer so I could again use Outlook, your project management and communication skills made the experience truly positive.</font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">Thank you for all you do! </font></div>
