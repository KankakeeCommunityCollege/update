<div><br />To: Michael O'Connor<br />From: Bert Jacobson<br />RE: Christopher Schilling<br /> <br />Mike,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last night we held a Green Drinks at River North restaurant and we had borrowed an LCD projector from IT for the event. I was panicked because the keys on the LCD were &quot;locked&quot; and I couldn't change the inoput from 'Input 1&quot; to 'Input 3'-the one for a laptop. I called the Help desk and Christopher helped me find a solution and saved the day!  This was not a problem he was familiar with, but stuck with it until we solved the problem.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you for all you do,</div>
<div> </div>
