<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass884E8F55D84649D3A46C2AA432137EC4"><p>​Employees are encouraged to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.<br /><br />There are two steps. <br /><br />First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.<br /><br />Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.<br /><br /><span style="color:blue">Thanks-a-gram</span>  <br /><br />TO: Denise Caparula<br />FROM: Pete Host<br /><br />I had the pleasure of having Denise Caparula assist me in getting information in Canvas to export to my Blackboard account. I had tried for days with the assistance from different tech people from other sources, all with no success. Denise was very patient and showed real expertise in finding a way to solve my problem.<br /> <br />In these days and times, too many people go unrecognized and unheralded for their performance of their job. While it may be her job, she went above and beyond what others tried. I feel that she should be recognized publicly for her diligence.<br /><br />It was nice to have someone available to solve my problem with patience and respect.<br /><br />Regards,<br />Pete Host<br /></p></div></div>
