<div><font size="2">The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.<br /> <br />Thanks-a-Grams have two components:<br />First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are </font><a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf"><font size="2">online</font></a><font size="2"> and in print in marketing and public relations.<br /> <br />Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.<br /> <br /><font color="#0000ff">Thanks-a-gram </font> </font></div>

<div><font size="2">RE: Electric Vehicle Road Trip</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />I would like to thank everyone who helped make KCC's leg of the IGEN Electric Vehicle Road Trip a success.  I want to thank Brad Hove for lending us a Nissan Leaf to drive our leg of the trip from KCC to Moraine Valley Community College by way of Prairie State College; Rich Soderquist, Brian Yeoman, Rob Kenney, and Todd Jenkins for getting the EV charger and the parking spaces at the NEC squared away; Kari Sargeant, Ellen Skelly, Liz Becvar, and Nancy Schunke for the inviting reception at the NEC yesterday morning, the press releases and the great news coverage; Rob  Stelmaszewski for the wonderful and timely refreshments; and Vicki Gardner, Mike Boyd, and everyone who came out to support the event.</div>
<div><br />The Electric Vehicle Road Trip was sponsored by the Illinois Green Economy Network in collaboration with Governor Quinn's Office; its purpose was to spotlight the ease to which electric vehicles could traverse the state---from Carterville (John A. Logan Community College) to Grayslake (College of Lake County) and to call out the community colleges that have made a commitment to electric vehicles and electric vehicle charging stations.</font></div>
