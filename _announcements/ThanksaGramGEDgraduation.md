<div>RE: GED Graduation</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">I'd like to express my heartful appreciation for your assistance in making the GED graduation a huge success.  Special kudos to the night crew and those who stayed over to ensure we were set up beautifully, despite our tight time frame due to another booking and our last minute change of venue. </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">When a possible change of venue was recommended, I couldn't believe that all the pieces would work together so PERFECTLY!  It was the best possible option!  Thanks, Don Hundley!  I can't even imagine what we would have done with the 300+ people in attendance without the change.  Tempers and the temperature would have made it a very uncomfortable ceremony.  As it was, both climates (mood and temperature) were pleasant!  As the people kept pouring in the student center, all of you ensured that the chairs kept appearing to make them comfortable while maintaining a visually appealing layout.   </font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">A special thanks to Stephen Dockemeyer and his crew for accommodating this last minute change with sound.  The sound system was easy to operate and just perfect for the space!</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">A special thanks to the Food Service, Inc. staff for accommodating the change in set up for the refreshments.  Your ideal to move the table away from the wall to allow two lines for faster service was perfect!  Everyone loved the cookies and punch.  There were no leftovers!</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">It's teamwork like this that makes me proud to be a member of the KCC team.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Thanks again,<br />Margaret</font></div>
