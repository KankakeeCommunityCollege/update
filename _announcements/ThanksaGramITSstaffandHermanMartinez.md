<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass81D76A70C2364C7CA3364417F500FDF6"><p>The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other. </p>
<p>Thanks-a-Grams have two components:</p>
<p>First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>
<p><span style="color:darkblue">Thanks-a-gram</span></p>
<p><span style="color:darkblue"></span><strong>TO:</strong> Jacob Fansler, John Alvarado, Aaron Nunley, Dave Massey and Herman Martinez<br /><strong>FROM:</strong> Kim DeYoung</p>
<p>Thanks to all of you for going above and beyond to help make our simulation experiences better for our students and faculty!</p></div></div>
