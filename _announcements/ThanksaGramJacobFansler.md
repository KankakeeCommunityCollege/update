<div>To: Jacob Fansler<br />From: Jessica Corbus<br />RE:Taking a stand - and making it better!!! Thank you!</div>
<div><br />Jacob,</div>
<div>You are the best! I truly appreciate your keen observation and self-motivation to take care of “the little things.” Taking the additional time to proactively check – and fix - all things ITS in my office while working on a separate project exemplifies exceptional customer service.  You identified a problem and resolved it - Thank you.  What may seem like a small thing to do, and perhaps you would say that it is just part of your job, turned into something so much more than simply switching out a phone. Thank you for the intention you put into your work to create random acts of kindness. There is no insignificant act of kindness. Even the smallest acts make the greatest impacts. It sure is a treat now to have a phone stand that works! I, myself, did not even realize the hassle it was until after you took the time to make it better. When I use my phone now I have a bigger smile on my face because I am more acutely aware of the positive energy created from you making things better.</div>
<div>Know I appreciate you and the opportunity to work with you!</div>
