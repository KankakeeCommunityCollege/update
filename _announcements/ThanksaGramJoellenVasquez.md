<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass0460160931CF41B79CD119AAAED4018C"><p>The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.<br /> <br />Thanks-a-Grams have two components:<br />First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.<br /> <br />Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>

<p>FROM: Candice Brackett</p>
<p>I just wanted to take time to say thank you for everything that you do for me as well as the athletics department. You are the glue that holds us together and I just wanted to let you know you are truly appreciated. I, personally, would be lost without you. :)</p>
<p>You are awesome!!! </p>
