<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass9475B4C1B0024782A41EEF5A5A5BA3EA"><div>The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.<br /> <br />Thanks-a-Grams have two components:<br />First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.<br /> <br />Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.<br /> <br /><font color="#0000ff">Thanks-a-gram </font></div>

<div>TO: Jude Austin<br />FROM:Jessica Corbus<br />RE:My &quot;Outlook&quot; is much brighter!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jude,</div>
<div>Thank you for the time you spent problem solving the issues with my desktop, specifically related to the Outlook issues. The way you approached the issue to not only identify the problem but also work towards a fix for the problem was fun watch. How you worked through the systems and problem-solved potential causes with such capability and speed is amazing - and to do all that while working through your lunch! Thanks to you, my &quot;Outlook&quot; is much brighter! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Most importantly, thank you for your positive approach and strong customer service skills. I appreciated how you engaged me in the process and kept me up to speed with what you were working on. While I truly have no idea about what you were doing, I felt like I was learning in the process. </div>
<div><br />Thank you for all you do! </div>
