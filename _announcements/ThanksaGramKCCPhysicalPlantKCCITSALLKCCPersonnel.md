<div><br /><font size="2">TO: KCC Physical Plant, KCC ITS, ALL KCC Personnel<br />FROM: Mary Decker, Coordinator<br />RE: Setting up the new SEC center</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">If you have not seen the new KCC SEC (South Extension Center), you are in for a real &quot;eye-opener&quot;. This was a major project which took place in an extremely short amount of time. Everyone was professional, courteous, and cooperative.  When the door opened on June 3, 2013, we were able to present to the residents of Iroquois County an innovative and dynamic educational institution. Without the help of almost the entire campus, the feat of opening might not have occurred. Yes, there were differences of opinions and thoughts; but ideas merged and a strong team network was created. I am very proud to show people around our new campus and the word is spreading that KCC is here to stay. My heart is in Iroquois County but I believe everyone who worked, called, delivered supplies, or ran an errand felt proud to be an integral part of the entire process. I especially thank the KCC Board of Trustees and Dr. Avendano who placed their trust in creating a new educational center during rather difficult economic times. I hope everyone has the opportunity to stop by and appreciate this fine new educational institution.</font></div>
