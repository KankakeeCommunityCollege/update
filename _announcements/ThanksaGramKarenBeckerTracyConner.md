<div><font size="2">The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.<br /> <br />Thanks-a-Grams have two components:<br />First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.<br /> <br />Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.<br /> <br /><font color="#0000ff">Thanks-a-gram</font> </font></div>

<div><font size="2">RE: Outstanding Service</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">I just wanted to make everyone aware of a wonderful partnership between the Miner Library staff and our sections of Business Communications this semester</font><font size="2">.</font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">Bus Comm is a general education course requirement in over 20 career and technical education curricula here at KCC.  The two major milestone activities in the course are a job search unit and a comprehensive company research project.  The job search unit, which accounts for half of the homework portion of the final course grade, involves thorough research on a prospective job lead and a comprehensive career and personal skills analysis.  This unit’s deliverables include a report on the skills analysis, a resume with cover letter mapped to the job lead, and business-appropriate thank you correspondence.  The comprehensive company research project, which accounts for 20% of the final course grade, requires in-depth research using library databases, evaluation of resources, demonstrated information literacy, and synthesis of resources into an executive summary and company journal.  This project provides experience in research, analysis, synthesis, and documentation of sources comparable to the deliverables in ENGL 1613 for CTE students who would not be enrolled in that course.</font></div>
<div> </div>
<div><font size="2">Bus Comm has long partnered with Miner Library staff to help students get started on their research and information literacy processes.  This semester, though, Karen Becker and Tracy Conner took this activity to an entirely new level with the inclusion of Lexis-Nexis Academic and the introduction of hour-long, small group meeting sessions outside of class.  This personalized approach gave students additional exposure to library resources as well as helpful suggestions and advice on how to best complete this project.  The improvement in the quality of our students’ work is already noticeable, and students have approached their time in the library with a level of confidence I have not seen before.  In a semester when I might have 60 to 90 students all working on a project of this magnitude, this level of individualized attention is a challenge.  To have two highly capable and qualified library staff provide similar advice and guidance is a tremendous asset to our students</font></div>
<div><font size="2">.</font></div>
<div><font size="2">KCC Bus Comm students are very, very fortunate to have two professionals of this caliber who have made such an investment in our students’ success in the course and beyond.</font></div>
