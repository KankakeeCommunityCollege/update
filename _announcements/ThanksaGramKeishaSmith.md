<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass4EF4DDF3E6F7457D802AAB96E97BFC4A"><div><font size="2">The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.<br /> <br />Thanks-a-Grams have two components:<br />First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.<br /> <br />Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.<br /> <br /><font color="#0000ff">Thanks-a-gram</font></font></div>

<div><font size="2">TO: Keisha Smith<br />FROM: Steve Makepeace<br />RE: Student Crisis</font></div>

<div><font size="2">What an incredible moment of truth in customer service. On Wednesday, August 21, Ms. Smith was our evening administrator. During the night I noticed a young lady apparently stressed out and just not coping well. She sat in the atrium and when one of our student custodial workers asked if she was alright, she burst into tears. I discretely contacted Keisha as I felt out of my depth. She immediately came down and asked me to describe the situation. She then proceeded to engage the student in a thoughtful way. The atmosphere was suddenly drained of tension as she discussed options and next steps for the young lady. My written words do not do this encounter justice. I was and am truly thankful for Keisha's professional caring demeanor, she was absolutely amazing in her handling of a potentially volatile scene. Kankakee Community College has a truly valuable asset in Keisha Smith.</font></div>
