<div><font size=2><br>From: Nicole Ford<br>In addition to all of our wonderful volunteers, I would like to send a special thank you out to Lindsey Fritz and JoEllen Vasquez for their parts in KCC's MatchPoints competition. Lindsey took over MatchPoints after only three weeks on the job! She has amazed me with her ability to learn quickly and pull together such a huge event in such a short amount of time! Lindsey you did an exceptional job! In addition, this event could not have happened without the expertise and experience JoEllen brought to the table! Her overall knowledge of the competition and willingness to jump in and help where ever necessary was priceless. JoEllen we owe you!!!! <br></div></font></div></div>
