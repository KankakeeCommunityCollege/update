<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassBDA3FE292055457A8870035216637EE2"><p>The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other. </p>
<p>Thanks-a-Grams have two components:</p>
<p>First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>
<p style="color:blue">Thanks-a-gram</p>
<p><strong>TO: </strong>Liz Becvar<br /><strong>FROM: </strong>Dr. Jill Channing</p>
<p>It is fabulous to work with Liz Becvar. She helped me with a survey that I will use to conduct my own research, and I hope to attract participants for the survey this week at the Illinois Council of Community College Administrators Conference.</p>
<p>Please know that I appreciate her and that she has considerable skill using SurveyMonkey. I look forward to learning more from her in the future.</p></div></div>
