<div><br>Recent 'Thanks-a-Gram':</div>
<div><br>To: Match Points volunteers</div>
<div><br>From: Lindsey Fritz and Nicole Ford<br>A big thank you to all of you (Sharon Hoogstraat; Laurel Soper; Joellen Vasquez; Monica Quinlan; Kari Sargeant; Ted Petersen; James Grimes; Glen OConnor; Penny Dickerson; Elizabeth Becvar; Meredith Purcell; Steven Makepeace; Nancy Schunke; Steve DePasquale; Ellen Skelly; Akilah Stewart; Kimberlee Harpin; Keisha Smith) who volunteered to make Match Points a success! Many of you stayed longer than anticipated to help out with matches that were running over time. I know that took a lot of time out of your day and I really appreciate it. I received many compliments from coaches that the matches were well-run and the day went smoothly, and that is all thanks to you! Match Points is a great opportunity for KCC to reach out to area high schools, and we wouldnâ€™t be able to do it without the help and support of the KCC staff and faculty volunteers.<br></div></font></div></div>
