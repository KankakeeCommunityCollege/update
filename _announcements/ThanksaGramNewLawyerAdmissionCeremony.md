<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassB76A86A1AA784D52BFFFD3DBCA164C69"><p>​The Employee Morale Committee encourages employees to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other. </p>
<p>Thanks-a-Grams have two components:</p>
<p>First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the Human Resources Department. Human Resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>

<p><span style="color:blue"></span><strong>TO:</strong> All who worked on the New Lawyer Admission Ceremony<br /><strong>FROM:</strong> Kris Condon</p>
<p>On Nov. 5, KCC met another milestone by being the first Illinois community college in the Illinois Supreme Court's recorded history to host the Court's New Lawyer Admission Ceremony. Twenty-seven new attorneys were administered the oath of office by Illinois Supreme Court Justice Thomas L. Kilbride in our Main Auditorium. It was exciting to see four Illinois Appellate Court Justices and ten judges of the Kankakee and Iroquois County Circuit Courts participate in the event as well.</p>
<p>None of that wonderful day would have happened without the help of these people:</p>
<ul><li>Chief Rich Soderquist, Deputy Chief Eric Springer, and Deputy Sheriff Ken McCabe: Thank you for you laser focus on the security details and all such an event involves;</li>
<li>KCC's security team, who are such pros and kept a lot of traffic moving with precision and professionalism;</li>
<li>Stella Mausehund and her Physical Plant events team, who set up the Auditorium and the Art Gallery so the entire day was walk-in ready--no one can appreciate the hours you spent to make this all look effortless;</li>
<li>Stephen Dockemeyer and Tyler Wheeler of Media, who set up, tested, and stayed on call with the sound system;</li>
<li>IT Services' Dave Massey and John Alvarado, who stayed on call with the technology in the Auditorium;</li>
<li>Arena Foods staff, especially Carrie and her team, for taking care of a wonderful catering event;</li>
<li>Kari Nugent and Diane Soltis of Marketing, who photographed and marketed every part of the event--all with a smile when last-minute changes were requested;</li>
<li>Mary Posing, who stayed on call when things got busy and who is always ready to lend a hand;</li>
<li>Our fabulous alumni and student ambassadors, who ensured that every guest was a VIP and guided each to the proper location quickly and efficiently;</li>
<li>Karen Slager, who managed calendars and schedules and greeted our guests;</li>
<li>Dr. Avendano and Dr. Boyd, who hosted the Court and our guests and who provided their support as we put this project together on a short timetable.</li></ul>
<p>This event was a great civics lesson for our students, and it makes me proud to work here when I know that KCC was the only place the Court contacted for this happy occasion. To see photos of the event, visit <a href="http://www.facebook.com/kccparalegal">www.facebook.com/kccparalegal</a>.
