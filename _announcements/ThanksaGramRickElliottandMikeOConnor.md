<div><font size="2">Rick and Mike, <br />I wanted to pass on a huge thank you for all your help with getting NextGen up and running for this scholarship season, especially in the accerlated time frame that it was needed. The season is now wrapping up as students are starting to redeem their awards, so we’ve gone full-cycle now. I cannot tell you how much easier the process was this year, even with having to build everything in NG. It was faster, smoother, and easier across the board – students, committees, our staff, and financial aid.  In addition, we saw a significant increase in the number of online applications.  Thanks again for everything you did to help make it happen. You guys are awesome!</font></div>
