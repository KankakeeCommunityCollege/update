<div>RE:KCC's 2012 Sustainability EXPO</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rather than sending separate &quot;Thanks- a - Grams&quot; to each of the groups and individuals mentioned above, I thought it was best and most appropriate to thank everyone as a &quot;group&quot;. It's appropriate because the success of this year's event, as with those of the previous 3 years, was  dependant on everyone working together as a &quot;team&quot; to achieve the goals of a successful event and presenting KCC in a very positive manner. I believe that we accomplished both of these goals in a sterling fashion! The setup and tear down for the event was done smoothly and efficiently. The various promotional needs, even the last minute ones, were  handled well. For the first time, we had Science Magnet grade school students (55 of them) attend as a field trip. They were given a tour of campus, and may well be our students in a few years. All who attended, from the 40 plus exhibitors, the KCC students and staff, the general public, and the grade school students and their teachers all enjoyed their visit and had positive responses when asked  about their experience.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When planning and organizing such events, it is very good to know that someone &quot;has your back&quot; and that the details and last minute issues that may come up will be addressed. Thank you all very much for &quot;having my back&quot; and helping make this year's event a success!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Regards,</div>
