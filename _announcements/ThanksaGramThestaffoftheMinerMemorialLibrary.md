<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass2C1E15CEFC844C3EBF45CEFE413EE576"><p>Employees are encouraged to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.</p>
<p>There are two steps. </p>
<p>First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in <em>Update</em> and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>

<p>TO: The staff of the Miner Memorial Library<br />FROM: Karen Becker<br />RE: Outstanding teamwork</p>
<p>I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge the wonderful team I'm privileged to supervise.  Individually you're great.  As a team you are awesome, exemplifying the core values of KCC. Your dedication and hard work was demonstrated during the months of January and February. We worked very hard to maintain our level of excellence while being short two staff. This could not have been done without your efforts. </p>
<p>Dorna Powell, Sarissa Boudreau, Joyce Urban, Krystel McKean and Linda Zullo, thank you for picking up the slack at the front desk. While maintaining your current responsibilities, you continued delivering excellent customer service.  </p>
<p>Tracy Conner, thank you for the work you have done with faculty and students. Although we were not able to maintain regular reference desk hours, you made yourself available to students and staff, providing leadership especially in the area of reference and instruction.</p>
<p>Barb Loudy, thank you for taking on the added duties of working behind the scenes. Your efforts kept us on track with the processing of new materials; your willingness to train on duties outside your normal scope of responsibilities and then train others exemplifies each of the core values.</p>
<p>You rock</p>
