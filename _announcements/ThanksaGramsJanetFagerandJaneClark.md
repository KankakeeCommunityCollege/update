<div><br /><strong>To:</strong> Janet Fager<br /><strong>From: </strong>Portia Calbert</div>
<div><br />In the very short time I've been employed here at KCC, Janet Fager has shown tremendous dedication, commitment and service to the entire KCC staff. While doing this she's undertaken the task of training me as her co-worker and I want Janet, and everyone else, to know how much I greatly appreciate her.</div>

<div><strong>To: </strong>Jane Clark<br /><strong>From:</strong> Josh Gregoire</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want to thank Jane Clark for always promptly answering my never-ending questions about benefits and also for superb attention to detail that saved me money on a recent dental bill.  Her extra effort was above and beyond and I really appreciate it!!</div>
