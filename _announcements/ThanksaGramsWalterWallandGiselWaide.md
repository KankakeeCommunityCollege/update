<div><font size="2">I would like to let Walt know that I truly appreciate his going above and beyond when we ran into a few glitches with our A2 testing a couple of weeks ago.  He demonstrated patience and professionalism (as he always does) throughout the entire ordeal; and he helped keep the students calm by telling them a couple of stories and working on a puzzle; thereby buying us time to get the issues resolved. Thank you so much Walt for a job well done!! </font></div>

<div><font size="2">RE: A2 Testing</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Thanks Gisel for all that you do to help ensure that the A2 testing sessions run as smoothly as possible.  A2 testing is a new process for us this year, so there are bound to be some kinks to be worked out.  Gisel helps schedule proctors for the test sessions, helps prepare the computers for the students to use, works with me and the proctor to get all of the students successfully logged into the test, and relieves the proctors for breaks. Your patience and assistance are appreciated.</font></div>
