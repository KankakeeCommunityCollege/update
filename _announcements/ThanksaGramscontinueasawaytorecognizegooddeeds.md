<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassCBA3B3147E1A4E7CB7E9971D4BFAD9D0><div>The Employee Morale Committee is encouraging employees to use a longstanding device to recognize each other.</div>
<div><br>“Please help support the program by participating and recognizing outstanding work when you see it,” said David Cagle, co-chair of the Employee Morale Committee. “It happens every day, sometimes we simply overlook it or take it-and others-for granted.”</div>
<div><br>The recognition program includes two components. First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are available <a href="/FacultyStaff/resources/Pages/default.aspx">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations. </div>
<div><br>Next, the person giving it can ask to make a copy and deliver it to the human resources department. If the recipient says it is OK, a human resources representative will post it on the new &quot;You Rock&quot; wall in the glass case north of Physical Plant Department.</div>
<div><br>The entry will also--with permission--be submitted to <em>Update</em>.<br></div></div></div>
