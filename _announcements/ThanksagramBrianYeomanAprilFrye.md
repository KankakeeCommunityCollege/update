<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass83C9D2E64C014B05982133AA9891F892"><p>​Employees are encouraged to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.</p>
<p>There are two steps. </p>
<p>First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>
