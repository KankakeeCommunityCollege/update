<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassF949C4139B0142F5B4F8370D9DF9BAF4"><p>​Employees are encouraged to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.</p>
<p>There are two steps. </p>
<p><img alt="Thanks-a-gram-icon.png" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Thanks-a-gram-icon.png" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>

<p>TO: ITS<br />FROM: KCC Foundation Staff<br />RE: Online link</p>
<p>After sending out invites to an event, we realized that we had not included an online payment option.  We brought our SOS to IT and they helped create an appropriate link to email to invitees.  Mike O'Connor and his crew were very helpful and made it happen quickly-We are so grateful!</p></div></div>
