<p>There are two steps. </p>
<p>First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>

<p><span style="color:blue"></span><strong>TO: Jennifer Huggins</strong><br />FROM: Linsey Cuti<br />RE: Excellence in Teaching Award</p>
<p>I just wanted to acknowledge Jen Huggins’ Excellence in Teaching in Developmental Education Award:</p>
<p>Jen, there is no one more deserving of this award. You started your full time position with the ball already rolling, responding to the national initiative to help developmental students more quickly get through their coursework, so that their momentum and finances wouldn’t dry up before they were able to move forward in credit bearing classes. And now, to reflect on the amount of ideas that have come to fruition because of your passion, hard work, and persistence is truly amazing. </p>
<p>In such a short time here, you have attended countless conferences, become inspired by either the largest or slightest strategy that would hope to improve students’ experience, help them succeed, and retain them. You didn’t just hear these ideas and think, “wow, that would be great to have at KCC” and let the ideas fall to the back burner and eventually out of your mind; instead, you returned and worked tirelessly and relentlessly until such ideas were implemented. You gently encouraged others to join your mission and cheered them on when they did. You took the heavy load of the work and did whatever possible to make it easy on those who joined you. </p>
<p>Because of you, we have a new model for developmental education; we have Success Coaches; we have new leadership and new ideas for the role of the Writing Lab; we have members from all facets of the college wearing your bright yellow “registered yet” shirts, and that only names a few of the Huggins-inspired initiatives. I know others helped, but most were likely driven by your enthusiasm and energy. </p>
<p>It is more than a pleasure to work with you. You have added so much to KCC in such a short time. You are inspiring, insightful, supportive, and fun. I am proud of you and feel very lucky that you are my colleague and friend.</p></div></div>
