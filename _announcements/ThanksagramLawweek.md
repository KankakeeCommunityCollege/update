<p>There are two steps. </p>
<p>First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are online and in print in marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>

<p><strong>TO: </strong><strong>Law week participants</strong><br /><strong>FROM: Kris Condon</strong></p>
<p>As we wrap up another terrific series of Law Week 2016 events, I’d like to give you a quick update and a thanks to all who participated.</p>
<ul><li>To our Town Hall Meeting participants, particularly Rep. Kate Cloonen and Attorney Lindsay Parkhurst—we appreciated the opportunity to host you on our campus and to hear your thoughts on the opportunities and challenges that face our district. Seventy-five people participated in this Law Week kickoff, and we’re so pleased that you accepted our invitation.</li>
<li>To Steve DePasquale, our moderator for Monday’s Town Hall meeting and our facilitator for Tuesday night’s discussion of Home of the Brave—your Law Week contributions are always thoughtful, insightful, and focused on important civics issues. Thank you for your contributions that brought another 75 community members to campus.</li>
<li>To Jan Glazar, Professor Jean Janssen, Assistant Public Defender Landwehr, and Police Chief Rich Soderquist, who judged our first-ever poster competition—we had 125 people in the Iroquois Room on Wednesday night to see our high school and junior high students’ efforts in interpreting the meaning of Miranda: Beyond Words. Thank you for your time, your effort, and your suggestions for improving the process for next year!</li>
<li>To all of our Hollywood Squares celebrities—Tinker Parker; Marisa Wiesman; Bridget Bertrand-Essington; Denny Marek; Imani Drew; Sheri Cagle; Ted Petersen; Kathy Thomas; and the incomparable center square, Dr. John Avendano—your philanthropy resulted in our generating $950 for Prairie State Legal Services. Between this and the monies the LEX Alumni raised during March’s Trivia Night, we’ve helped PSLS generate over 15% of their total fundraising goal for the year and brought 60 people to campus in the process.</li>
<li>To David Cagle—who stepped into the role of Hollywood Squares emcee at the last minute and made it look like he had done it forever—we are so indebted to you. You were a natural and are fantastic. Thank you!</li>
<li>To John Willard and the Highway Construction Careers Crew, who built our celebrity tic-tac-toe board—you are the unsung heroes of Thursday evening with your construction efforts. What a great group of construction professionals in the making through your terrific program.</li>
<li>To KCC’s Physical Plant Department, especially Stella Mausehund—I’ve never seen anyone work so hard all day, every day, and still finish the day with energy to spare. I appreciate your commitment to our successful week and am very glad you were part of it!</li>
<li>To Kari Nugent and the Marketing Team—our marketing was, as always, professional, inviting, and effective. Thank you so much!</li>
<li>To Stephen Dockemeyer and Tyler Wheeler—our sound system was spot on every night, and that was no easy feat with wiring a tic-tac-toe board for sound! THANK YOU. You spend hours to make it look like it was so easy, and it was so appreciated.</li>
<li>To the LEX Honor Society Alumni, particularly President Eric Curtis and question-writer Krystel McKean—your leadership sets the standard for students to follow. Thank you!</li>
<li>To Bridget Bertrand-Essington—we are most fortunate to have a faculty member of your caliber and commitment leading such an exceptional program. Thanks to you and your students for the partnership. I appreciated the opportunity to tag team with you this week and look forward to more of the same.</li>
<li>To Samantha Sweeney of the Women’s Bar Association—Thank you for including Bridget and me in Friday’s “Shadow a Lawyer” program and the opportunity to visit prospective students at the Law Day luncheon. We appreciate your partnership and collaboration and are grateful that our students got to see the Third District Appellate Court in action thanks to you.</li></ul>
<p>To see photos of the week’s events, go to the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/kccparalegal">Paralegal Facebook page</a> and visit the 2016 Law Week Events album. The individual photos of the poster contest winners are in the Miranda album.</p>
<p>Our next steps will be to submit an application to the American Bar Association for an Outstanding Law Week Award, and you’ll be the first to know! Again, thank you for your support of KCC, the Paralegal Program, and our students.</p>
<p>With appreciation, Kris</p></div>
