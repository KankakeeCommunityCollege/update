As a result of being faculty club sponsors, we regularly interact with Lindsey.  She makes every effort to fulfill our club’s needs, offers excellent ideas and opportunities for our club, and is such a pleasure to work with. We have never experienced such a comfortable and productive relationship with Student Life before Lindsey’s arrival. She is a true treasure to KCC.</div>
