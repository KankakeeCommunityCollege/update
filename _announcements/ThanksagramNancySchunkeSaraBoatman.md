<p>There are two steps. </p>
<p>First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are <a href="/FacultyStaff/documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>

<p>TO: Nancy Schunke &amp; Sara Boatman<br />FROM: Linda Berg<br />RE: Thanks and appreciation</p>
<p>Sending a belated, yet heartfelt &quot;Thank You&quot; to Nancy Schunke and Sara Boatman for coming to my assistance on March 3rd (day of the bad ice storm). Sara answered her phone at 6 a.m. and told me right where to find the salt; and Nancy took charge handling everything else (including the power outage). Thanks for your assistance very early in the morning (long before you were supposed to be here). I was able to unload the CPR equipment and get set up just in time for students arriving at 8 a.m. I feel very blessed to work with such dedicated and giving ladies. Thanks!!!!</p>
