<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass844A84227A374D94ADC4F1312CD1DD78"><p>​​Employees are encouraged to use Thanks-a-Grams as a way of recognizing each other.</p>
<p>There are two steps. </p>
<p>First, present a &quot;Thanks-a-Gram&quot; to a deserving co-worker. Thanks-a-Grams are<a href="/FacultyStaff/Documents/thanksagram.pdf">online</a> and in print in marketing and public relations.</p>
<p>Second, the person giving it can give a copy or email it to the human resources department. Human resources will ask the recipient(s) if it is OK to be published in Update and posted on the &quot;You Rock&quot; wall north of Physical Plant Department.</p>

<p><strong>FROM: Mary Polka</strong></p>
<p>RE: Physical Plant Department</p>
<p>Wanted to extend a big thank you for your dedication to your student worker duties in the Mailroom and Shipping/Receiving. The three of you together make a great team and your work ethics show in the time you spend in PPD. You guys take charge and complete your work assignments with little direction. You make sure the plant is clear and<br />all jobs are complete on a daily basis, its gets crazy in PPD and you guys step up every time.</p>
<p>You are seen making daily deliveries in all areas of campus and I continually receive compliments on how great you guys are!</p>
<p> You guys rock!</p></div></div>
