<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassE8F7D9DF5B094256953D255A6D224102><div><font size=2>From: Virginia Makepeace; chairperson, Math, Science and Engineering Division</font></div>
<div><font size=2></font> </div>
<div><font size=2>    On Tuesday, Feb. 8, KCC hosted the regional 2011 WYSE - Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering - Academic Challenge.  </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    We had 207 students from 14 local high schools competing in seven different subject areas. The top teams and top individuals in each subject advance to the sectional WYSE competition at North Central College next month.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    I would like to express my gratitude to all the people and departments from around campus that helped make the competition a success. Most importantly, Alison Nakaerts handled virtually all of the organization in the weeks leading up to the competition day. Thanks are also in order for those who helped with the competition itself: John Avendano, JP Cohen, Amy Comerford, Judy Downey, Pat Durham, Nicole Ford, Jessica Greminger, Frances Hebert, Bert Jacobson, Carrie Jones, Mark Lanting, Bob Ling, Steve Makepeace, Martha Makowski and Terese Roberson. </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    Finally, those people and departments that contributed from behind the scenes: Linda Chouinard, Brad Logsdon, the Athletic Department, Food Services, Media, and the Physical Plant Department.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    It would not have been possible for KCC to host this event without the willingness of all these people to share their time and effort--thank you for helping to make WYSE a success!  <br></font></div></div></div>
