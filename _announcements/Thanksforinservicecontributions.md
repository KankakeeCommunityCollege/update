<div>The Faculty Growth and Development Committee would like to thank everyone who assisted in making the Fall 2011 in-service successful. </div>
<div><br />Physical Plant Department, Information Technology Services, Food Service staff, and speakers worked hard to make this event as beneficial as possible to those in attendance. The positive feedback we received included appreciation for the quality of each presentation, the awesome breakfast and the location of the social gathering.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was an honor to serve our full-time and adjunct faculty, staff and administrators in this capacity.  Good luck as you begin the fall semester. Remember to keep an eye toward the windshield and rear view mirrors as you travel down the educational freeway.</div>
<div> </div>
