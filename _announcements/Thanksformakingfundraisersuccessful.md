<p>The Office of Student Life would like to thank everyone who donated to the Student Advisory Council’s “Choose the Torture” fundraiser.</p>
<p><img alt="DrAAustinBarnett5_7_15.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/DrAAustinBarnett5_7_15.jpg" style="margin:5px" /><br />The fundraiser was held from April 6 - May 1 in honor of Austin Barnett, a local child battling cancer. Students, staff and faculty donated toward &quot;tortures&quot; for Dr. Avendano to complete. The options were: dress like a Cavalier, eat bad jelly beans, and an ice bucket challenge. </p>
<p><img alt="AustinBarnettCheck5_7_15.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/AustinBarnettCheck5_7_15.jpg" style="margin:5px" /><br /><br />The most popular donation option, and the one he completed, was to dress like a Cavalier on May 7. The same day, the Student Advisory Council presented Austin and his family with a check for $300.</p>
<p>A special thanks to KCC’s marketing department, Arena food service, Physical Plant Department, members of KCC’s Student Advisory Council, Karen Slager, Dr. Avendano, and all those who generously made a donation to support Austin and his family. </p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
