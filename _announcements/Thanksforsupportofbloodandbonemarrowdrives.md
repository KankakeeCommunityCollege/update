<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass3579D491FA204CF69E7846049617332C"><p>​The Office of Student Life and Phi Theta Kappa would like to thank everyone who donated at the Red Cross Blood Drive and Bone Marrow Drive on Dec. 3. </p>
<p>KCC’s goal was to collect 25 units of blood. That goal was exceeded! </p>
<p>Laura Gardner, coordinator of student life and development, said &quot;Thank you for making a difference and supporting the local community.&quot; she also provided some additional information about blood donations: </p>
<ul><li>Every two seconds someone in the U.S. needs blood;</li>
<li>More than 41,000 blood donations are needed every day; </li>
<li>A blood  donation can help save the lives of up to three people </li></ul>
<p>More about the Red Cross is at <a href="http://www.redcrossblood.org/">http://www.redcrossblood.org/</a>.&quot;</p>
<p>At the Phi Theta Kappa bone marrow drive, 25 people went through the initial process to be placed on the registry. Donations of $53 were received to send to the <a href="http://www.bethematch.org/">BeTheMatch organization</a>. Contributions help recruit and add more potential donors to the registry so transplants can become a reality for all patients. <br /></p>
