<p>On Monday, Aug. 3, 116 golfers enjoyed a beautiful day of golf at the Kankakee Country Club.</p>
<p>In addition to 17 holes of golf, the event included lunch, seated chair massages by KCC Massage Therapy students, social hour and dinner. The evening program included a motivational message by KCC's athletic director, Ted Petersen, who shared his wisdom about teamwork and philanthropy. </p>
<p>The event raised $44,000 (to date) for scholarships for students, athletic programs and unmet needs. Sincere thanks to all who volunteered, sponsored, golfed or contributed in some way to make the event a success. <br /></p>
