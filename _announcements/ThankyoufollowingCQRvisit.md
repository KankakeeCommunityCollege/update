<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE4520A11F2E04F47B9EA4CC11B738159"><p style="color:#00558d">​<span><em>Submitted by the KCC HLC &amp; CQR Committees </em></span></p>
<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>The Comprehensive Quality Review (CQR) team completed their visit today, and the Higher Learning Commission (HLC) will provide their decision on reaffirmation of accreditation for the next eight years in approximately three months. </p>
<p>AQIP provides the structure for what all 530 employees already do so well, which is provide quality instruction and support for our students, and the KCC faculty and staff members of HLC and CQR committees are happy that the CQR team was able to hear the voices and see the faces of so many who make a difference every day for students. Due to the tremendous work and dedication by all those involved before and during this visit, the KCC HLC and CQR committees would like to thank:</p>
<ul><li>Dr. Avendano and the Board of Trustees for welcoming the CQR team first, and showing commitment and engagement that set that tone for the whole visit. </li>
<li>The President’s Cabinet for meeting with the CQR team individually and together to discuss the current state and future direction of their respective departments and the college as a whole, and providing tours of our extension sites. The work led by every faculty and staff member under your leadership was communicated superbly in your meetings with the team. </li>
<li>The Faculty Association leadership for meeting with the CQR team, representing those who tirelessly and continuously impact students each day through quality instruction.</li>
<li>Marketing and Public Relations Department for meeting with the team, but especially for the countless materials, <em>Update</em> articles, and webpages dedicated to AQIP and CQR information.</li>
<li>Student Services, for discussing the critical services provided to our students, from financial aid guidance to academic advising and transfer services, helping thousands of students each year to navigate their educational path. </li>
<li>Instruction and Student Success Division leadership: From associate deans to teaching and learning leadership, the work you and your teams do to ensure learning outcomes are achieved by students was presented wonderfully.</li>
<li>AQIP project team leaders, for sharing progress of projects that continue to impact the college in ways that will last beyond the project “completion” dates. </li>
<li>Over a dozen students, representing our Student Advisory Council, Student Ambassadors, Phi Theta Kappa, and Baccalaureate Scholars. Their willingness to come in on a holiday to share feedback with the CQR team was invaluable. Additional students participated in the open forum for students yesterday.</li>
<li>The SPOC Committee, Assessment Committee, Faculty Growth and Development Committee, Online Leadership Committee, Curriculum and Academic Standards Committee, and Program Advisory Council members for providing insight into how student outcomes are achieved, how the college mission is furthered, and how the needs of community partners are met collaboratively. </li>
<li>Diversity initiatives staff for sharing the roles each of you have in the growth and development of all our students. </li>
<li>Judy Downey and Karen Slager for scheduling, ordering, arranging, and then doing it all over again moments later when more changes were requested. Their patience never wavered, and is deeply appreciated. </li>
<li>The KCC Police Department for ensuring parking for our guests, the Physical Plant Department staff for ensuring the rooms and table arrangements were perfect during their visit, and Information Technology Services staff for ensuring internet access for the team.</li>
<li>Arena Food Service staff for providing great meals to the team, and when they met with students.</li>
<li>All those who attended the faculty, staff, and student open forums to share feedback to our CQR team; the voice of every person is important.</li></ul>
<p>We are grateful as well to all those not named or listed above, because your work every day for students, both in and out of the classroom, was represented in the materials for, and the meetings with, the CQR team.  </p>
<p>From the KCC HLC and CQR committees, thank you for making the CQR visit a success, but more importantly, thank you for the work you do every day to ensure the success of our students.</p>
<p><br /><span style="color:#0072bc">Additional note from Purva DeVol, Accreditation Liaison Officer</span></p>
<p>As chair of the committees, I would like to thank each faculty and staff member of the KCC HLC and CQR committees. Their dedication and extraordinary effort, starting last spring, to ensure all required documents for the CQR visit were submitted, including the above and beyond effort of writing an optional report, represents our collective, college-wide commitment to the AQIP pathway.</p></div></div>
