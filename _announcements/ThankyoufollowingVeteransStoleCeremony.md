<div>On behalf of the veteran students &amp; faculty, Cari Stevenson and I, we would very much like to thank the following people for helping us make the Veteran’s Stole Ceremony a success. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Your willingness to help us honor our veteran students &amp; faculty with short notice is a testament to the commitment to our veterans here at KCC. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We'd like to especially extend our gratitude to Dr. John Avendano, Michael Curtis, Kendra Souligne, Laura Gardner, Kelly Myers and the KCC Foundation, Marketing &amp; Media, KCC Food Service and Physical Plant Department. <br /> </div>
<div>Also, if any veteran faculty or staff who are wearing gowns during graduation were unable to attend the ceremony and would like to wear a stole, please contact Cari or me. </div>
