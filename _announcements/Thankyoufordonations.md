<p style="margin:0in 0in 10pt" class=MsoNormal><span><font size=3>On behalf of KCC's Students for Animals club, I want to extend my thanks to the staff &amp; community for donating items to our shelter drive. It is the clubâ€™s hope that we can continue collecting these much needed items for the shelters and be some help in their tireless efforts to care for the homeless animals of our community. </font></span></p>
