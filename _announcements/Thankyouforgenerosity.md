<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass6D77901C996344369DF749B174CBC69C"><div><br />Heartfelt thanks for the generosity of our KCC family for the donation to the Isaac Mackey Fund.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tracy Mackey, (Isaac’s mother) said “Thank you so very much for your donation. It has touched us so very much!<br />Love, Eric, Tracy, Isaac &amp; Maya.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In Isaac’s words, “Wow!”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Isaac is recovering comfortably at home. He had surgery on Wednesday (Jan. 9) and amazingly was released that Saturday afternoon.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The night before surgery, Isaac asked his Mom and Dad to sit by him on the couch and pray. After the prayer he said “I know that things are going to go smooth tomorrow.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are all truly blessed and we're held in the palm of his hand with all the kind words, thoughts and prayers; before, during, and after surgery.</div>
