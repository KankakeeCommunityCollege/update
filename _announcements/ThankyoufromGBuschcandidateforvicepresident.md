<div><em>The following note was received from Gregg Busch, who visited KCC on March 26 as a candidate for the open vice president position.</em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div>Greetings,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just wanted to drop a quick note to express my appreciation for the kind welcome and hospitality during my visit to KCC last week.  It was a pleasure to meet each of you and spend time discussing our mutual interests in higher education and specifically, community colleges and KCC. Special thanks to Dr. Avendano for your time spent introducing me to Kankakee and surrounding communities and Mr. Cagle and his associates in human resources for coordinating my visit and making my travels effortless. Appreciation also to those whom I met at the open sessions. I enjoyed our dialog very much.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My continued best wishes to KCC and your search committee and I hope, through your process, you are will find a good match for this important position on your team.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Best regards,<br />Gregg Busch<br /></div>
