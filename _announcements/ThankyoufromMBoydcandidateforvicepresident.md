<div>I am writing to express my sincere gratitude for the opportunity to speak with you earlier this week. The hospitality and warmth each of you showed me over the course of the day was truly world class. I am encouraged and excited by the current spirit and energy on your campus; KCC is poised and ready to do great things for the students in your district. Throughout the day, I heard a similar message. That message emphasized a commitment to collegiality and teamwork as you strive deliberately to be an innovative and impactful leader for your community.</div>
