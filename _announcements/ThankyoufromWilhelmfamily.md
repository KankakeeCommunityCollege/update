<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassDC76E675AB9C458F8DDF8FDC932879B2><div>Following is a note and a letter from Susan Wilhelm, wife of KCC Professor Tim Wilhelm.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><font color="#000080">The introductory note:</font></div>
<div> </div>
<div>My apologies for taking so long to thank you and all those who sent the Shell gas card. By the way, it was the perfect gift! We truly appreciate all the visits and support from Tim's KCC family. I have written a letter to thank the many people who have given so much love and support to us, and this includes many of the people at KCC.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><font color="#000080">The letter is dated Dec. 12, 2011:</font></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dear, dear friends,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Forgive the generic greeting, but there are so many wonderful people to thank that writing individuals letters would be staggering. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tim and I have been simply stunned and amazed by the loving support that our many friends have blessed us with over these past weeks. I feel terrible that it has taken so long to sit down to express our deep gratitude and appreciation for the many gifts, large and small, that we have received.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many unexpected gifts have appeared out of nowhere… firewood delivered, the lawn mowed, firewood stacked, food appearing in our refrigerator … offers of many kinds of help from countless people. Admittedly, it is not easy for either Tim or me to ask for help and we like to be “self-sufficient” in all ways, but this is one time when I know in my heart that we need help. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If this were a sprint, we would do it alone, but I know it’s a marathon, and it is profoundly humbling to realize that even the Wilhelms need love and support from others. I have to thank you all for knowing that even before we did, and for giving so generously of yourselves with love and kindness. The gratitude we feel has brought us both to tears, and we can never really express how deeply we have been touched by this flood of caring and support.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tim had a check-up at Loyola last Tuesday and the surgeons said that although his wounds look like they are healing well, his X-rays showed slower healing of his bones and he still is not allowed to bear weight on his legs for another six weeks.  Also he has a long blood clot in his right leg that they are keeping an eye on. Tim is able to get into an electric wheelchair that he maneuvers down the hall and to physical therapy once a day. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>He looks like his old self, except bearded and quite a few pounds lighter. The weight loss will be beneficial for his physical therapy once he can begin putting weight on his legs again. He is more his old self, but is tired a lot, perhaps from the medicines he is being given. It is fine to visit Tim now, and I think he looks forward to a little company during the day when I am not there, so feel free to stop in and say &quot;hello.&quot;</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On this bitterly cold December night, I am warmed by the love of friends far and near who have reached out to us with kindness and affection that Tim and I will remember for the rest of our lives. Tim is stronger every day and I know we will get through this and get our lives back again. As we move forward, we will take the love and kindness given us so freely and “pay it forward” to others in need. In the meantime, please know that we love you all and appreciate your kind and thoughtful gifts, thoughts, and prayers. I do believe the prayers may have saved his life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With gratitude and love,</div>
<div>Susan</div>
