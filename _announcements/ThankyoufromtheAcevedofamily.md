<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass33E8B686E4D04236B8B65DBDEB8F9741">
<div>The family of Pablo Acevedo has sent a card to KCC with the following inscription:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&quot;Your kindness and sympathy are more deeply appreciated than any words of thanks can ever express.&quot;</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In a handwritten note, it says &quot;Our family would like to thank all of you for the monetary gift for our father. My father loved KCC as his second family which is why even after retiring he went back to paint! You guys kept my dad young!&quot;</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The card was signed by Anna Stewart, Rosa Acevedo, Pablo Acevedo and Martin Acevedo.</div>
