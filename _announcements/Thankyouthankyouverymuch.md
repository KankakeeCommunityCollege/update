<div>&quot;Thank you, Thank you very much&quot; as of course Elvis would say seems just not enough!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To say I am blessed is an understatement as we all are blessed who have experienced KCC in some way! What a party from walking in to the Elvis tunes to the peanut butter and banana sandwiches and beautiful flower decor, everything was wonderful. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I cannot put into words the warm feelings from my heart to yours. Thank you for being there, for the hugs, kind words, and just sharing in my happiness to transition into retirement. I will never forget any of it and I will carry a part of each and every one of you with me in my next journey where ever God leads me on that path.</div>
