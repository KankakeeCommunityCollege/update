<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassFB8ADA08C21347CBAC8A4D6144771158"><p>​Thank you to everyone who volunteered their time to read scholarship applications.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, we will be sending an email to all readers providing information about outcomes. This year there were twice as many scholarships to read as last year. We realize that there were also a few barriers created by NextGen (scholarship software) upgrades. Your patience and caring commitment is truly appreciated. </p>
<p>By reading scholarships, you gain a greater understanding of our students, their needs and experiences/accomplishments. We hope our program assists all KCC scholars in successfully completing their education. The program also provides them with opportunities to meet their donor and gain an appreciation for philanthropy. Our goal is to steward these student leaders to become future supporters of KCC.<br /><br />Sincere thanks,<br />The KCC Office of Institutional Advancement <br /></p>
