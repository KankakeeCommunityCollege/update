<div><br>    A second campus event the &quot;Jazz Countdown,&quot; was presented by Willie Dixon on Feb. 14.</div>
<div><br>    Many thanks to all on campus who were part of the many months of planning which made these events a reality and to those who helped in the final execution of those plans. We couldn't have done it without their great team spirit! A very special thanks to the marketing and media departments for the outstanding artistic work they did for the fliers and other publicity. </div>
