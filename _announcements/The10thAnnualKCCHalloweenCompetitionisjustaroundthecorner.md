<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass36F034B7ABEC436A88B7CEF8FAFF0FCF"><p>​<img width="447" height="335" alt="Halloween_2016.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Halloween_2016.jpg" style="height:201px;width:268px;vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />We had our summer fun this year; now it is time for the start of some fall fun.</p>
<p>The annual Halloween contest will be on Tuesday, Oct. 31. This will be the 10th year that areas of the college have competed against each other for the best Halloween costumes and department theme.</p>
<p>&quot;I can’t believe we have been holding this fantastic annual competition on the main campus for 10 years now,” said Sheila Pfaff, one of the competition organizers. &quot;I hope those brain juices have been flowing over the past year and people aren’t stuck in the Beetlejuice waiting room! I can’t wait!&quot;</p>
<p>Each area's theme must be kept under wraps to keep the competition from borrowing ideas. As an incentive, the winning department will keep the “Fabulous” Traveling Tacky Trophy and will be able to show it off until the 2018 competition.</p>
<p>There also will be a Traveling Tacky Trophy for best costume. The winner of the best costume does not have to be part of one of the office/area themes.</p>
<p>If your department or staff in your area would like to get into the spirit of the day, please contact Sheila Pfaff, spfaff@kcc.edu or <span class="baec5a81-e4d6-4674-97f3-e9220f0136c1" style="white-space:nowrap">815-802-8700<a title="Call: 815-802-8700" href="#" style="overflow:hidden;cursor:hand;border-top:medium none;height:16px;border-right:medium none;width:16px;vertical-align:middle;white-space:nowrap;right:0px;border-bottom:medium none;position:static !important;float:none;left:0px;margin:0px;border-left:medium none;display:inline;top:0px;bottom:0px"><img title="Call: 815-802-8700" alt="" style="overflow:hidden;cursor:hand;border-top:medium none;height:16px;border-right:medium none;width:16px;vertical-align:middle;white-space:nowrap;right:0px;border-bottom:medium none;position:static !important;float:none;left:0px;margin:0px;border-left:medium none;display:inline;top:0px;bottom:0px" /></a></span> by Friday, Oct. 20.<br /><br /></p></div></div>
