<p>It was a a frightful scene when those witches started their shenanigans. </p>
<p><img alt="winifred_update.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/winifred_update.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />Linda Chouinard also took first place in the individual costume category as Winifred &quot;Winnie&quot; Sanderson. </p>
<p>Second place in the department contest was a tie. The Cauldron of Witches and Big Bad Wolf of the Continuing Education and Career Services/Institutional Effectiveness captured as many votes as the Barbies and Kens of Marketing/Media. </p>
<p>Three other participating departments also put on a good show.</p>
<p>The Big Things of Adult Education displayed no small feat of imagination. Big Easy, Big Apple, Froot Loops and milk... is anyone else hungry just remembering it all?</p>
<p>Going to the Big Top Circus of the Foundation was as much fun as watching a clown tame a lion, on a flying trapeze, while eating cotton candy.</p>
<p>The crisp surroundings and hot tub of the Winter Wonderland in the Academic Offices in Room L355 might gotten some people wishing for snow. The weather outside cooperated.</p>
