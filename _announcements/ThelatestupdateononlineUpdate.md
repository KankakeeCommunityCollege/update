<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass64204348551C4DC59FC5084983AC4F47><div>    <font size=2>The test of the online version of <em>Update</em> is continuing.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    Most feedback received so far has been positive. With that in mind, it is likely the <em>Update</em> newsletter will be online only within the next few weeks.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    When the transition is complete, a weekly e-mail reminder will be sent to all employee groups, and to the retirees and friends of the college who have requested to receive <em>Update</em>.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    Here are a few notes related to the online version of <em>Update</em>:</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    -- A new feature has been added. It is a page with articles added within the last week and events which occur within the next seven days. To see these items, choose the &quot;Recent Updates&quot; link on the left.</font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>    -- The archives are up-to-date. To see the archives, choose the &quot;Update Archives&quot; link on the left.<br>    -- A few issues are still being worked out. The search function on the archives page and the RSS feeds both need some work before they reach full functionality. <br>    </font></div></div></div>
