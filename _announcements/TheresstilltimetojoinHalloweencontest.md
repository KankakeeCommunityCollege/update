<div>Submitted by: Ghoulish Halloween planners in Room L355<br /> <br />There are only two weeks until Halloween and we have a few areas joining the annual Halloween decorating contest: Room L355 and Admissions &amp; Registration. <br /><br />Anyone else interested? Student Services? LRC? W102? Media? Once again, everyone will get to participate by viewing the decorated departments and casting secret ballots for the winner.<br /><br />We understand with the current economic crunch that no one wants to spend money on a Halloween contest, but there are many ways to be creative with your theme without spending a dime. We've even seen how crafty and imaginative some of you are, so we know you can come up with some pretty cool ideas! It's time to put on those thinking caps!<br /><br />Please let either Sheila Pfaff or Alison Nakaerts know by Friday, Oct. 21 if your area is going to join in on the Halloween Decorating Competition. <br /><br />Don't forget ... a full year of bragging rights is up for grabs</div>
