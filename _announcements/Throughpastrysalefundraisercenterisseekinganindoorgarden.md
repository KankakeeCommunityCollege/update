<div> </div>
<div>The Child Development Center is having its fall fundraiser! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are trying to raise money for a Light Garden. Plants tend not to last long in the center, since we have no natural sunlight coming in. A Light Garden will allow plants to bloom year round and help bring our Science Center alive!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The fundraiser is a pastry sale. Orders and full payment are due no later than Oct. 7, 2013. Pastries can be picked up at the Child Development Center on Monday, Oct. 21, from 4-6 p.m. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Order forms are located in the Child Development Center, the Staff Dining Room next to the College Center, and in the Student Services break room. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Questions? Give me (Katie Giblin) or Tammi Simon a call at 815-802-8505. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As always, we appreciate your support!</div></div></div>
