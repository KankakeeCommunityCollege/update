<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass0E5E9EFA529147F79F7E9528732F547B"><div> </div>
<div>It’s time to gather together and celebrate the grand tradition of an all-employee (faculty &amp; staff, full- &amp; part-time, student workers) holiday party beginning at 12:30 p.m. on Friday, Dec. 20 in the College Center.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All areas of the college will cease operations at noon on Dec. 20. This will allow employees to gather for the entire celebration. Following the luncheon and party, all employees are invited to use the remaining afternoon hours to take down holiday decorations and prepare for the new year before adjourning for winter break. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here are the details:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>• Bring your favorite covered dish to the Cavalier Room by noon. We ask that everyone who eats lunch brings a dish to share so there can be enough food for everyone.<br />• The meat, plates, napkins, plastic ware, bread and condiments will be provided. <br />• Bring a drink, too; beverages will not be provided. <br />• The room will be cleaned at 3 p.m., so please pick up your dishes by then.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In response to employee feedback, we have made a couple of changes this year, starting with eating in the College Center to accommodate more people. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>There’s no need to line up early. Rather than having a food line, employees should sit at numbered tables in the College Center. At 12:25 p.m., random drawings will determine when people seated at the tables go through the line. Everyone will have an equal chance to be at the front. Food tables will be set up with selections on both sides to speed up the line.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After lunch, we will have some brief entertainment, including the “Most Festive Holiday Socks” contest. Winners (male and female) will receive prizes based on a round of applause. If you still want to be adorned with your holiday sweaters (ugly or not), feel free to do so. The luncheon will conclude with closing comments from Dr. Avendano.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you want to wear jeans for the entire week of Dec 16-20, please donate $10 to the United Way (a sticker will be given to you to wear to show your support). KCC cookbooks also are still available for $10. Denim week stickers and cookbooks are available at the main receptionist desk and in the Human Resources Office.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finally, The championship game in the <a href="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/pingpongbracketsdec2013.pdf">KCC Holiday Ping Pong tournament </a>for the United Way is scheduled for noon that day, so feel free to come down and watch/cheer.<br /></div>
