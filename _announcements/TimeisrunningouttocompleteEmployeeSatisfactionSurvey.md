<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass99C96ACE25854354A07C7FB2969F18C4"><p style="color:blue">Submitted by David Cagle, director of human resources</p>
<p>​As of Friday, Feb. 13, 105 employees have completed the Employee Satisfaction Survey.</p>
<p>Our goal is 210 employees, so we are currently at 50 percent with two weeks to go. The survey closes at 11:59 p.m. on Saturday, Feb 28. It was emailed to employees the morning of Feb. 3 with the subject line &quot;Link to Employee Satisfaction Survey.&quot;</p>
<p>We are encouraging all full-time employees, current adjunct instructors, and part-time employees averaging 16 hours or more of work per week to complete the employee satisfaction survey. It should take about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>This is the sixth year KCC has used Noel-Levitz to administer the survey. It allows for confidentiality, a comparison between years to see how we are doing, and comparisons among KCC and approximately 30 other community colleges across the nation.</p>
<p>So if you haven’t taken the survey as of yet, please do so – your feedback is welcomed and valued.</p>
