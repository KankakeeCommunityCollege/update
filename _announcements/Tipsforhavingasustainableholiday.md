<div><em>Editor's note: The following is adapted from an email from </em><a href="http://www.catalogchoice.org"><em>www.catalogchoice.org</em></a><em>, a free online mail preference service that assists individuals with reducing unwanted mail.</em></div>
<div><br />Our wrapping paper, decorations, shipping materials, etc. turns into 25 million tons of solid waste—and paper is just the beginning.</div>
<div><br />Many communities all over the U.S. post lists of holiday waste reduction tips online, so we decided to highlight the best of what we've seen:</div>
<div><br />1. Reuse foam peanuts. Most packaging materials for shipping can be used more than once.<br />2. Compost your leftover food. It's easy and makes for a great fertilizer!<br />3. Wrap creatively. Use comics, old maps, sheet music, fabric/wallpaper scraps. And use fun tins and food boxes you crush and recycle for gift containers.<br />4. Make festive recycling bins. They're a great addition for your holiday party and a great activity for kids.<br />5. Give the gift of time or talent. Take someone to a play, concert or movie. Make your own gift certificates. Offer your talents like photography or financial planning.<br />6. Help your friends go green. Give planet-conscious gifts like compost bins, can crushers, water timers, programmable thermostats, rain barrels, bird feeders, light timers or bat house.<br />7. Buy outdoor light strands that are wired in parallel. If one bulb goes bad, the others still work, so you won't be throwing away entire “bad” strands.<br />8. Keep it simple. One thoughtful gift is better than six wrapped packages of unwanted gifts.<br />9. Don't wrap oversized gifts. Hide them and give clues. Make gift-giving into a treasure hunt.<br />10. Plan previously-loved or homemade gift exchanges. Books, a restored piece of furniture or a rebuilt bike can be cherished for many years and by many people.<br /></div>
