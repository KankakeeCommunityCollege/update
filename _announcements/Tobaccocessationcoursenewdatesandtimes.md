<p><font size=2><font style="font-size:10pt">KCC is moving in the direction of a tobacco-free campus, with an anticipated implementation for Fall 2011.<br><br></font></font><font style="font-size:10pt">Because it is understood that this will be difficult for those who smoke or use other tobacco products, the college is offering a tobacco cessation course, beginning Feb. 28.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:10pt">It is open to full- and part-time employees, as well as family members who are part of the KCC insurance plan. The $25 cost to participate will be paid by the college. Course materials include a Freedom from Smoking workbook and nicotine patches.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:10pt">The seven week/eight session program will meet 3:30-5 p.m. on seven Mondays and one Wednesday as follows: Feb 28, March 7, 14, 21, 23, 28, April 4, and 11. The class will meet in Room D212.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:10pt">To sign up, please contact the first floor receptionist. Enrollment will be limited to 30, with a minimum of eight.</font></p>
<p><font style="font-size:10pt">Anyone with other ideas about ways assistance could be provided to making this transition, please e-mail David Cagle at <a href="mailto:dcagle@kcc.edu" target="_blank" shape=rect>dcagle@kcc.edu</a>.</font><font style="font-size:10pt">  <br></p></font></div></div></div>
