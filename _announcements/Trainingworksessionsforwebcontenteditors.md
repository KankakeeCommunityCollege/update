<p>Are you responsible for editing web content? Attend a training/work session offered by the Office of Continuing Education and Career Services. No registration is needed.  </p>
<p>The format is fluid, based on those attending. You can get the basics or use the time as a work session to update your content. KCC’s SharePoint experts will be there to give tips and answer questions.</p>
<h2>Session times</h2>
<p>Morning (9-11 a.m.) and afternoon (1-3 p.m.) sessions will be offered in Room D122. If you missed the Feb. 25 sessions, no worries, there are still sessions on the following days: <br />• Wednesday, March 25<br />• Wednesday, April 22<br /></p>
