<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass6F5525B9F28848F6AA14EBA00AFADAD2">
<div><font color="#003366">From Rich Soderquist, director of facilities and campus safety</font></div>
<div><br />The college has taken the first steps in the transition from a security department to a campus police department. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The required documents have been submitted to the Illinois Training and Standards Board for approval. The ITSB is the governing body for law enforcement agencies throughout the state. The certification process has a number of phases and the process may take months to complete. In the meantime the college will continue to provide public safety and security as before.</div>
<div><br />In conjunction to the state certification process taking place, arrangements are being made internally. As part of the transition, I will be participating in the 12-week State of Illinois law enforcement training and certification program and will be away from campus Oct. 1 to Dec. 22. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I will not be available to check voice mail and email on a regular basis. Therefore, some managers and supervisors will be adjusting responsibilities, areas of focus, and schedules. Some of these changes will be permanent, and others will be temporary during the transition process</div>
<div><br />Effective Monday, Oct. 1:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>• <strong>Brian Yeoman</strong> and <strong>Eric Springer</strong> are sharing managerial responsibilities for physical plant operations and public safety. Brian will primary manage building operations, mechanical systems operations, School Dude work order requests, 1st and 2nd shift custodial operations, and building mechanical emergencies. Eric’s primary responsibilities will be to manage public safety and security.</div>
<div><br />• <strong>Rob Kenney</strong> supervises the building maintenance and repair staff, supports Brian on supervising building work requests, the internal renovations program, and he will facilitate the north extension center project. He also can be called for building repairs.</div>
<div><br />• <strong>George Mateja</strong> manages all external Physical Plant campus operations, weather response (such as snow, damaged trees, flooding, etc.), landscape/horticulture improvements, and sports field/golf course management. </div>
<div><br />• <strong>Stella Mausehund</strong> coordinates the administration for all events requested through R25 which require PPD participation, custodial student workers, as well as other internal physical plant programs.</div>
<div><br />• <strong>April Frye</strong> (first shift) and <strong>Don Hundley</strong> (second shift) supervise custodial operations, and custodial service requests.</div>
<div><br />• <strong>Mary Polka</strong> administers and assists in managing the service programs and communications for the Physical Plant department (key requests, vehicle reservations, radio communications, shipping and receiving, and mail room). For an immediate response to an issue such as a water leak or room temperature concern, contact Mary at 815-802-8174 and she will radio for assistance. Other work requests should go through the School Dude program to Brian Yeoman. </div>
<div><br />• <strong>Fred Schultz</strong> manages the contract security officers and responds to all public safety concerns and security situations.</div>
