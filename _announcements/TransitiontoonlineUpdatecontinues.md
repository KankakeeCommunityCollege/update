<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassA9948D9B5A7C4623828336FADEFE4720><div><font size=2>From: David Cagle, director of Human Resources<br> <br>Use of RSS feeds is suggested</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>As <em>Update</em> information is added online at <a href="http://www. kcc.edu/update">www. kcc.edu/update</a>, it also can be received as an RSS feed message.</div>
<div><br>After subscribing to the <em>Update</em> RSS feeds, new items to the events and announcements will automatically be sent to users' RSS feed folders in Outlook.</div>
<div><br>    Here's how to subscribe:<br>    1. Visit <a href="/update/">www.kcc.edu/update/</a></font><font size=2>.<br>    2. Scroll down until you see the <img alt="RSS feed symbol" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/RSS_feed.JPG"> symbol (on the right side of the screen). Click on it.</font></div>
<div><font size=2><br>    3. Click &quot;subscribe to this feed&quot; (see figure 1).<br> </font></div>

<p><br>    Here are a few notes related to the online version of <em>Update</em>:<br>-- A new feature has been added at </font><font size=2><a href="/update/">www.kcc.edu/update/</a></font><font size=2>. It is a page with articles added within the last week and events which occur within the next seven days. To see these items, choose the &quot;Recent Updates&quot; link on the left.</font><font size=2><br>-- The archives are up-to-date. To see the archives, choose the &quot;Update Archives&quot; link on the left.<br>-- A few issues are still being worked out. The search function on the archives page still needs some work before it reaches full functionality. </font><font size=2><br> Readers are encouraged to check out the online Update and/or to subscribe to the RSS feeds. Anyone with comments on Update in general or the online Update is invited to provide feedback as well.<br> </font></p></div></div>
