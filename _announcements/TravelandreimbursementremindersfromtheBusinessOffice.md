<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassA3DD50D0D0BE40C1B2C74D26054455AA><div><font size=2>    The Business Office would like to remind everyone of a few points pertaining to travel forms and staff reimbursements.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    Please remember the following:<br>    -- If there is an item on a receipt that you would like to point out, please circle it instead of highlighting it. The forms are imaged, and in the process, highlights disappear and/or black out the item.</div>
<div><br>    -- If a staff member purchases an item from a vendor who accepts KCC purchase orders, tax will not be reimbursed to the employee.<br>    -- Please turn in original receipts with reimbursement requests and travel expense reports.<br>    -- An out-of-district travel request should be turned in before traveling and should include some form of documentation on the purpose (i.e. brochure, registration form, agenda) of the trip.<br>    -- Meals from restaurants in the KCC district are not reimbursable for out-of-district travel.<br>    -- Travel expense reports should be returned in a timely manner. The recommended timeframe is within a week of travel. It should not exceed 30 days after travel was completed.<br>    -- Even when no reimbursement is requested, a travel form should still be turned in for out-of-district travel.<br>    -- Meals for day trips may be taxable. This means that if you turn in the receipt for reimbursement, you may be taxed on the whole bill, not just your portion.<br>    --In order to be reimbursed for meal expenses on travel forms, an itemized receipt must be provided. Turning in only a credit card receipt is not acceptable. </div>
<div><br>    If you have any questions, please contact Angela Kunce at 815-802- 8122.    <br> </font></div></div></div>
