<div> </div>
<div>In the coming two months, the Physical Plant Department will begin to implement a new tree improvement and replacement program.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In conjunction with the University of Illinois and the KCC Horticulture program, the college has completed a study of the campus trees. This assessment was done to address the quality, health and safety of the trees that beautify the main campus, its courtyards, parking lots and student use areas. Some trees were found to be compromised as far as factors related to root growth, environmental conditions and invasive species.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Over the next few seasons, the department will be trimming, removing and, in some cases, replacing trees.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Where appropriate, a landscape plan will be implemented that incorporates mixtures of turfgrass, flowering native plants, ornamental grasses and other suitable ground covers to create a diverse and formal-appearing landscape with reduced maintenance inputs.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The tree and landscape improvement program is an extension of the campus master plan, the campus conservation master plan, the college's commitment to reduce carbon emissions, the college safety program, and the college's commitment to sustainable storm water management practices.</div>
