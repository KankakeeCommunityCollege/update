<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass313DE201BAC24DBD9B59D62EB1208A1E><div><font size=2>From: Kris Condon, sponsor of the KCC chapter, Lambda Epsilon Chi National Honor Society in Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies </font></div>
<div><br><font size=2>With a record number of 14 teams playing 10 rounds of trivia, Prairie State Family Trivia Night this past Friday (April 1) was a huge success. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>The event raised $2,485 to benefit Prairie State Legal Services, the community's provider of low-cost legal services to low-income and senior citizen families. When added to the profits from the Trivia Night held Jan. 28, the total raised is $3,685. To have two KCC-sponsored events help PSLS meet 20 percent of their campaign goal is remarkable! </div>
<div><br>Our own “Paralegals Rock” team (with members Dr. and Mrs. Avendano; Michael Roof; Mary Nolan; Becca Hoffman; and Jennifer Reynolds) did a great job as well, although no one can beat Judge Kramer’s son Jack in the “heads or tails” competition. Young Jack won $27, which we all hope he will use for KCC tuition in some future semester!</div>
<div><br>Our goal was to have a good time for a good cause, and I'm proud of our students' efforts. Thanks to everyone who participated and showed our guests why our middle name is &quot;Community.&quot; </div>
<div><br>I heard comments all evening about our paralegal students and alumni and how professionally they presented themselves to campus visitors, and if you were there, you saw it, too. They make KCC look good. Thanks to all of them. </div>
<div><br>Special thanks to Marketing and Media for their publicity and their work with AV setup, especially Kari Sargeant, Stephen Dockemeyer, and Nathan Harrington. As always, Eric Springer, Don Hundley, and the rest of the PPD team got everything looking great in the College Center. Auston Minnich and the FSI team kept everyone well-fed with popcorn and chips and salsa. Thanks, too, to Lindsey Fritz for helping coordinate refreshments.</div>
<div><br>Thanks to everyone for their help and support of a most worthy cause!<br></div></font></div></div>
