<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass64E300BF8B5A40FEB5ED8118F4964386><div><font size=2>The KCC ALIVE Adult Literacy program offers tutor training for new volunteers.<br></font></div>
<div><font size=2>ALIVE volunteers assist adults with learning how to read or improving their basic skills in reading, writing, math and English.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>Once trained, volunteers meet with their students at locations convenient to both parties--such as local libraries, churches or community centers. The time commitment is about two hours per week. <br></div>
<div>Training is available through a computer-based online course taken at the convenience of the prospective tutor. <br></div>
<div>The ALIVE program serves adults in Kankakee and Iroquois counties. It is supported by the Secretary of State Literacy Office and United Way of Kankakee County.</div>
<div><br>For program information or training registration, contact Shannan Carrell in the KCC-ALIVE office at ext. 8307 or email </font><a href="mailto:scarrell@kcc.edu"><font size=2>scarrell@kcc.edu</font></a><font size=2>.<br></div></font></div></div>
