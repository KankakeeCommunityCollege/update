<div><span style="font-size:10pt;color:black;font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'"> <br>They are encouraging fellow employees to wear the ugliest holiday sweater (or attire) you can find on Tuesday, Dec. 21.<br>Perhaps you received one several years ago from grandma, or maybe you will go thrift shopping to locate your &quot;gem.&quot; </span></div>

<div><span style="font-size:10pt;color:black;font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'">David Cagle found this year's holiday garb at Ditto (formally Seconds to Go in Meadowview) and had a lot of fun doing so. That's the intent -- to have fun and be festive, celebrating another semester of hard work by all. </span></div>
<div><span style="font-size:10pt;color:black;font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'"><br>All that is asked is that your sweater (or attire) be &quot;appropriate.&quot; All those wishing to participate in the contest will be invited to come forward during the potluck and the winners will be chosen by applause. Prizes win be given to the top male and female Ugliest Holiday Sweater winners. </span></div></div></div>
