<div> </div>
<div>Since the holiday season wouldn't be the same without a fun holiday wardrobe contest, this is the year of &quot;festive socks.&quot;</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Human Resources Department is encouraging fellow employees to wear the most festive holiday socks you can find on Friday, Dec. 20.<br /></div>
<div>&quot;Perhaps you received a pair several years ago from grandma, or maybe you will go thrift shopping to locate your 'gems,'&quot; said David Cagle, director of human resources and coordinator of the contest. &quot;I found this year's holiday stocking on Ebay.&quot;So let’s all participate, have fun, and be festive, celebrating another semester of hard work by all.&quot;</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To participate, find some socks which are festive and appropriate. Wear them to work Dec. 20. Everyone wishing to participate in the contest will be invited to come forward during the holiday lunch potluck. Winners will be chosen by applause. Prizes will be given to the top male and female with the most festive holiday socks.</div>
