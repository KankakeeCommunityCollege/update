<div>Submitted by Dr. John Avendano, president<br /> <br />KCC kicked off the 2011-12 internal United Way campaign on Thursday, Sept. 29.<br />  <br />Fifty-one faculty and staff stopped by the Cavalier Room on day one of our campaign, and pledged donations totaling $9,544. We are off to a great start in accomplishing our goal of raising $22,000! Outstanding!<br />   <br />I want to congratulate the following lucky winners who will be parking in my former space in the Prairie Lot beginning in January:</div>
<div>January, Kellee Hayes; February, Jeni Chaffer; March, Laurel Soper; April, Becky Wilder; May, Rexann McKinley; June, Jane Clark; July, Eric Springer; August, Karen Bayston; September, Karen Devine; October, Mendy Corbett; November, Ken Crite; and December, Sharon Hoogstraat.<br />    <br />Everyone who made a pledge at the kickoff received a door prize. </div>
<div>A special thank you goes out to Mary Posing, David Cagle, Janet Fager, Sheri Cagle, and Penny Dickerson for &quot;Giving more than a Little Bit&quot; of their time and efforts to make this event so successful.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you were unable to attend the kickoff, there is still time to pledge your support. We won't be closing out our campaign until December.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In addition to making a donation or pledge, you still can assist our fund-raising efforts in two other ways:</div>
<ol>
<li>Participate in the Third Annual KCC &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; 5K for United Way on Saturday, Nov 5.  <br /></li>
<li>Purchase easy-to-prepare meals, snacks, and desserts from Schwan's Home Service to KCC. We have three more days scheduled, Oct. 18 and Nov 15 from noon - 5 p.m.; and Saturday, Nov. 5 from 8-11 a.m. If purchases exceed $750 each day, KCC's United Way campaign will receive a 10 percent commission. Our first Schwan’s fundraiser on Sept. 20 resulted in $930 in sales, resulting in a $93 donation to our UW campaign. Thanks to all who purchased quality food items from Schwan's!</li></ol>
<div>As always, thank you for your generous support of this most worthwhile agency.  </div></div>
