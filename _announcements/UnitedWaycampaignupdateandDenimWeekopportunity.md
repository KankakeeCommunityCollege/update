<div> </div>
<div>If you haven’t made a pledge to the United Way yet, there is still time to do so.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So far, 76 employees have made a pledge, totaling $10,609.  This amount, plus the $3,032 that was raised in the 5K for the United Way on Oct 10, and $195 in miscellaneous donations, brings our total to $13,836. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This total represents 72.8% of our goal of $19,000. Ideally, we can attract at least 24 more employees to make a donation to close in on the $5,164 shortfall.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another effort to raise funds for the United Way will be &quot;Denim Week,&quot;  offered the week of Dec 17-20. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For a $10 donation, you can wear jeans to work each day that week. To participate in Denim Week and get your “Dollars for Denim” sticker, please bring a $10 donation to David Cagle in human resources.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As always, we thank you for your continuous support of United Way!</div>
