<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass8F1D8F6243D84F2392DCAC4854EAFF19><div><font size=2>From: David Cagle, co-chair of KCC's United Way campaign<br> <br>    With only THREE days remaining before the United Way's 2010-11 campaign concludes, KCC has raised 19,813.63. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    This exceeds our goal of $18,500 by 7 percent and everyone is to be commended for their support and giving. </div>
<div><br>    The community is still in need and the United Way of Kankakee County is still trying to reach its goal of $1.1 million. I would love for KCC to raise $20,000 or more. </div>
<div><br>    If you haven't yet given, there are still three days. There are still 20 pay periods this calendar year. If 10 or more faculty and staff donate just $1 per pay period (or 5 employees to donate $2 per pay period), we will surpass the $20,000 mark. Please help. Visit the human resources office and fill out a pledge form.  </div>
<div><br>    On a related note, there are only three days to buy a $100 raffle ticket for the UW Wheels and More program. At its annual meeting March 31, the United Way will give away more than 10 grand prizes, totaling more than $45,000.The prize list includes chances to win...</div>
<div><br>    • A choice of vehicle(s) valued up to $35,000 manufacturer's suggested retail price from Taylor Chrysler Dodge Jeep of Bourbonnais.<br>    • A three-night, four-day trip to Las Vegas, including hotel and airfare.<br>    • Four tickets to a Chicago Bears game, with seats in the United Club and pre-game sideline passes.<br>    • Four tickets to a Chicago White Sox game, in the scout seats, Section 131, Row 7.<br>    • Three different fitness packages.<br>    • An iPad donated by Best Buy.<br>    • Four tickets to Chicago Cubs vs. Chicago White Sox on July 2, Section 118, Row 6.<br>    • Golf package with rounds at five area golf courses.<br>    • Dining package with gift cards from 10 area restaurants.</div>
<div><br>Each ticket sold guarantees the purchaser a number of free items, including </div>
<div><br>    • A pass for up to four people to visit Hidden Cove Sportsplex and enjoy arcade games, pizza and soft drinks (a $75 value). <br>    • A haircut from SportClips.<br>    • 13 items at Kankakee, Peotone and Beecher McDonald's restaurants.<br>    • Lunch or dinner buffet at Chicago Dough Co. in Bourbonnais.<br>    • Chiropractic evaluations from Van Till Chiropractic and Dr. Brent Adams.<br>    • A month of membership for new members at Fitness Premier in Bourbonnais.<br>    • Cleaning of one room of carpet.</div>
<div><br>    As always, I  want to thank everyone who has supported United Way. In difficult economic times, the demand for health and human services is greater than ever in our community I am proud to know KCC does its part. Thank you for fulfilling the 'Live United' theme. Raffle tickets are available from David and from Vicki Gardner, who currently serves as president of the local United Way board of directors. <br> <br>               </font></div></div></div>
