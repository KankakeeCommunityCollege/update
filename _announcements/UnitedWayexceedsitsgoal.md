<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassF72A226E241F4238B887FA4F30AAE57E"><p style="color:blue">​<span>Submitted by David Cagle, KCC United Way drive chair</span></p>
<p>At the annual dinner on Thursday, March 26 it was revealed that the <a href="http://www.myunitedway.org/">United Way of Kankakee &amp; Iroquois Counties</a> exceeded its goal of $900,000, raising a total of $924,326.</p>
<p>It couldn't have been done without the support of KCC, in fact the college was well represented throughout the evening. KCC was recognized as the no. 13 top employer in giving, raising a total of $15,472 for the campaign. </p>
<p>Dr. John Avendano and Lisa Dugan co-chaired this year's successful campaign. For their leadership efforts, they were recognized as United Way &quot;Volunteers of the Year!&quot; </p>
<p>Sheri Cagle, who just completed her first year on the United Way board received the United Way &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; award.</p>
<p>&quot;It was an honor and a privilege serving as co-chair with Lisa Dugan on the United Way Campaign this year,&quot; said Dr. Avendano. I was proud of KCC's representation throughout the campaign, and most proud of the community and the United Way reaching and exceeding its goal of $900,000. I want to express my sincere appreciation to everyone who contributed or volunteered their time, talent, and treasure for this year's campaign.&quot;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no one from KCC won the $30,000 car, but two KCC faculty members did win nice secondary prizes. Jennifer Blanchette won a $50 gift card to <a href="http://www.busseandrieckflowers.com/">Busse And Rieck Flowers Plants &amp; Gifts</a>; and Debbie Podwika won a $50 gift card to <a href="http://www.bradleysalonandspa.com/">Rumors Salon &amp; Day Spa</a> in Bradley. </p>
<p>The United Way of Kankakee &amp; Iroquois Counties funds 45 programs at 24 agencies, focusing on education, income, health and basic needs.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who contributed to the success of this year's campaign!  And once the spring weather arrives and stays here, Dr. A and Phil Kambic, president &amp; CEO of Riverside Medical Center, will hand wash cars of the 21 KCC employees who gave a gift of $260 or more.  <br /></p>
