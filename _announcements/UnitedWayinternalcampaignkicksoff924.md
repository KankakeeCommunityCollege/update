<div><br />Hello everyone!</div>
<div><br />
<div style="float:left;margin-right:6px"><img alt="United Way Logo" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/United%20Way.jpg" /></div>
<p>The United Way of Kankakee County officially kicked off its campaign at The Fieldhouse in Bourbonnais on Thursday, Sept. 6 in conjunction with the kickoff of the NFL season. </p></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Two former and local Superbowl Champions were there: our own Ted Peterson and Tyjuan Hagler. The theme of this year’s campaign is “Local Faces, Local Impact,” co-chaired by Jeff Smith and Marty Whalen. <br /></div>
<div>KCC will kick off its internal United Way campaign on Tuesday, Sept. 24 from 10 a.m. - 3 p.m. in the Cavalier Room. All full- and part-time faculty, supportive staff and administrators are encouraged to attend and show their support. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I realize you were just asked to consider making a pledge to the KCC Foundation Employee Giving campaign, in which many of you did. We thank you for that! Yes, the two campaigns are close together, but both are worthwhile. Next year, the two campaigns might even team up so we won’t have to ask you multiple times to give. This is also done at several other community colleges.  <br /></div>
<div>Refreshments will be provided for those who donate, and there will be a drawing for prizes at 3 p.m. Once again, we will offer a prime parking spot in the Prairie Lot to 12 lucky individuals.<br /></div>
<div>Please remember, all donations go to United Way of Kankakee County and 98 cents of every dollar donated stays in the Kankakee area. United Way’s work is divided into four categories: education, income, health &amp; wellness, and basic needs. United Way of Kankakee County supports 45 local programs and 24 member agencies, serving more than 65,000 people per year. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>I want to thank all of you who contributed in the past and I hope we can count on your support again. In difficult economic times, the demand for health and human services is greater than ever in our community. I am proud to know KCC does its part.<br /></div></div>
<div><font color="#993300"><strong>5th annual 5K for United Way is Oct. 9</strong></font></div>
<div> </div>
<div>In addition to making a donation or pledge, employees, students, and members of our community can assist KCC’s fundraising efforts by participating in the 5th Annual “KCC 5K for the United Way” on Wednesday, Oct. 9 at 4:30 p.m. The <a href="/Community/Documents/UnitedWay5k_2013flyer_pledgesheet.pdf">attached flier</a> has more details and a registration form. Registrations will be accepted at the event.<br /> </div>
<div>To boost participation, there are discounted rates for students and KCC employees. </div>
<div> </div>
<div> The minimum donation for KCC employees is $15 until Sept. 25; $20 after Sept. 25. The minimum donation for students is $10 until Sept. 25; $15 after Sept. 25.<br /><br /></div></div></div>
