<div><font color="#000080">From: Dr. John Avendano, KCC president<br /></font> <br />Hello everyone!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The United Way of Kankakee County officially kicked-off its campaign on the courthouse front lawn on Saturday, Sept. 15. The theme of this year’s campaign is “United Way Works Around the Clock.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC will kick off its internal United Way campaign on Tuesday, Sept. 25 from 10 a.m. - 3 p.m. in the Cavalier Room. All full- and part-time faculty, supportive staff and administrators are encouraged to attend and show their support. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Refreshments will be provided for those who donate, and there will be a drawing for prizes at 3 p.m. Once again, we will offer a prime parking spot in the Prairie Lot to 12 lucky individuals.<br /> <br />As you may know by now, I love to set goals for us as individuals and as an institution. Gifts to United Way by KCC employees totaled a just a little bit more than $18,000 last year and KCC was honored as one of the top 10 employers in giving. This year, I would like to set a new goal for us: $19,000! In order to reach that goal, it will take everyone's cooperation.   <br /> <br />Please remember, all donations go to United Way of Kankakee County and 99 cents of every dollar donated stays here. United Way of Kankakee County supports 45 local programs and 24 member agencies, serving more than 65,000 people per year. <br /> <br />In addition to making a donation or pledge, employees, students, and members of our community can assist KCC’s fundraising efforts by participating in the 4th Annual “KCC’s 5K for United Way” on Wednesday, Oct. 10 at 4:30 p.m.. The <a href="/documents/2012unitedway5kform.pdf">attached flier has more details and a registration form</a>. Registrations will be accepted at the event.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To hopefully boost participation, we have discounted the rates for students and KCC employees. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The minimum donation for students (KCC/other colleges/universities/high school and grade schools) is $10 until Sept. 26; $15 after Sept. 26.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The minimum donation for KCC employees is $15 until Sept. 26; $20 after Sept. 26. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want to thank all of you who contributed in the past and I hope we can count on your support again. In difficult economic times, the demand for health and human services is greater than ever in our community. I am proud to know KCC does its part.</div>
