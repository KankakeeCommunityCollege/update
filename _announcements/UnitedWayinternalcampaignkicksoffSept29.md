<div>From: Dr. John Avendano, KCC president</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hello everyone! </div>
<div><br />I recently attended the United Way of Kankakee County campaign kick-off.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>At this event, the goal of raising $1.1 million was revealed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last year, our local UW came close to raising this amount, ending the campaign at $1,075,000. This goal was not just a random number, but one based on ACTUAL NEED. As you know, the local economy has not fully recovered and the human/social service agencies and programs United Way offers locally still need your support to meet basic human needs like food, clothing, and shelter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As you may also know by now, I love to set goals for us as individuals and as an institution. Gifts to United Way by KCC employees totaled $20,000 last year, surpassing our goal of $18,500 and KCC was honored as the ninth top employer in giving. This year, I would like to set a new goal for us: $22,000, an increase of 10 percent. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It will take everyone's cooperation in order to reach this goal.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We will kick off our internal campaign on Thursday, Sept. 29 from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Cavalier Room. All full- and part-time faculty, supportive staff and administrators are encouraged to attend and show their support. </div>
<div><br />Refreshments will be provided for those who donate, and there will be a drawing for prizes at 3 p.m. Once again, we will offer a prime parking spot in the Prairie Lot to 12 lucky individuals. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>All donations go to United Way of Kankakee County and 99 cents of every dollar donated stays here. United Way of Kankakee County supports 45 local programs and 24 member agencies, serving more than 60,000 people per year. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In addition to making a donation or pledge, employees, students, and members of our community can assist KCC’s fundraising efforts in two other ways: </div>
<div><br />1) Participate in the 3rd Annual KCC &quot;Give a Little Bit&quot; 5k for United Way on Saturday, Nov 5 at 9 a.m. (<a href="/Community/Documents/UnitedWay5K_2011regforms_0912.pdf">see attached flier</a>).</div>
<div><br />2) Purchase easy-to-prepare meals, snacks, and desserts from Schwan's Home Service to KCC. There are more than 400 items to choose from. Schwan’s will be at KCC Sept. 20, Oct. 18, and Nov. 15 from noon to 5 p.m. See related article about Schwan’s procedures. If purchases exceed $750 each day, KCC’s United Way campaign will receive a 10 percent commission. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want to thank all of you who contributed in the past and I hope we can count on your support again. In difficult economic times, the demand for health and human services is greater than ever in our community. I am proud to know KCC does its part. Thank you in advance for fulfilling the &quot;Live United&quot; theme.<br /></div></div>
