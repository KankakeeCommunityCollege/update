<div> </div>
<div>The 2012 United Way of Kankakee County campaign is winding down and we could still use your help to reach our goal of  $1.1 million.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To meet that goal, the United Way is having a Wheels-and-More raffle. Visit the <a href="http://www.myunitedway.org/2012_Wheels_and_More.php">Wheels-and-More raffle page</a> for prizes, a list of coupons every ticket buyer receives and contest rules.  This year the total coupon value is over $1,100.00! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>It is very easy to purchase ticket(s): come see me. I have some in my office. Tickets will be on sale until Feb. 29. </div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Only 2,000 tickets will be sold. Make sure your friends, family and co-workers know about the raffle, too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As always, I appreciate your consideration and continued support of the United Way and its 24 partnering agencies.</div>
<div> </div></div></div>
