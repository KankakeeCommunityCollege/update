<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass779B3EEB8EDD43F09356DEFB278BDB52>
<div><strong>From: </strong>John Avendano, president</div>
<div><br>To everyone who contributed to this year's United Way Campaign, I say Thank You!&quot; </div>
<div><br>Because you “gave a little bit” your gift will provide ...</div>
<div><br>- Education supplies for a literacy program that serves 25 students. <br>- Bread for children at a United Way partner agency for a month.<br>- Five youth the opportunity to participate in a youth sports program.<br>- Six months of crisis services for a client of a mental health program.<br>- One year of meals for a homebound senior citizen. </div>
<div><br>And, because you “gave a little bit,” KCC reached another goal and demonstrated to our community how much we care and how we can accomplish anything we strive to accomplish. I am so proud of everyone's efforts and contributions that helped us exceed our goal of $18,500<font color="#000000">. To date, we have raised $18,608 </font>and I know we still have half of the proceeds from the White Christmas musical revue on Dec. 16, as well as another community wide Dollars for Denim Day next February that will add to this amount.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Perhaps when it is all over said and done, we can surpass $20,000! Thank you all once again for your contributions and commitment to our community!</div></div></div>
