<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass072BE85FFEC6490893E611ADFED6F252"><div><font color="#333399">Submitted by David Cagle, KCC United Way campaign chair</font></div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC’s United Way campaign kicked off on Sept 25. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since then, 66 employees have made pledges totaling $9,376. KCC’s 5K for the United Way, held on Oct. 10, netted another $3,007. So we have raised a total of $12,383 toward our goal of $19,000 (65%).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Congratulations goes out to Mike O’Connor for coming in second overall in the race, and for being the first KCC finisher of the 5K.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Mike ran at a pace of 8:01 per mile to finish with a time of 24:52. Our fearless president, Dr. John Avendano, finished 7th overall with a time of 26:19.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jenny Rogers was the first female KCC finisher with a time of 27:12. She finished in 16th place overall. Shelby Corbett (Mendy’s daughter) was the first female age 14 and younger finisher, with a time of 31:09.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The 5K event had a field of 112 participants and donors, including 31 employees and their family members,  the KCC women’s basketball team, and softball team. A special thanks goes out to Coaches Dennis Clark and Donnie Denson for their support! In fact, the women’s basketball team raised $747 in additional pledges for the event!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The United Way campaign video for this year is now available. It is entitled “Full Circle,” and features the new executive director of the United Way, Nick Allen. In the past, Allen and his family benefited from some United Way programs. The &quot;Full Circle&quot; video includes a picture of KCC’s very own Charles Cruz, custodian I, standing with Nick next to a Christmas tree. The video can be viewed on <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3z4tSBmXpE">You Tube</a>. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you haven’t made a pledge and wish to do so, there is still time – please complete the <a href="/Community/Documents/2012-UW-Pledge-form.pdf">attached pledge sheet</a> and return it to the Human Resources Office.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As always, we thank you for your continued support of the United Way.  <br /></div>
