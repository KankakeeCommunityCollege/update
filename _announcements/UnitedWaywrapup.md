<p>The local campaign celebrated its 75th year, and there was more than $755,554 raised. KCC's internal campaign, which has $13,110 in contributions, set the college as 11th on the list of organizational contributors. </p>
<p>During the annual dinner, winners of the Wheels and More Raffle were drawn.</p>

They got to choose a vehicle (valued up to $30,000) from Taylor Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram in Bourbonnais. David is KCC's director of human resources. He also chairs the college's United Way campaign and is a former United Way board member. Sheri is associate dean of the Health Careers Division, a current United Way board member, and chair of the allocations committee. Congratulations to them!</p>
