<div>On Tuesday, Feb. 8, KCC will host the regional 2011 WYSE – Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering – Academic Challenge.</div>
<div><br>About 210 students from 14 local high schools will be competing; the students will arrive on campus at 9 a.m. and will depart around 2 p.m.</div>
<div><br>The academic challenge is a battery of tests created by the Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering program and offered to high school students. Subjects tested are biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering graphics, English, mathematics and physics. The goal of the Academic Challenge is to acquaint high school students with the course content and the level of competition that they will experience upon entering a science or engineering curriculum at the college or university level.  Consequently, the test content will challenge the brightest students.</div>
<div><br>Volunteers are needed to proctor exams at 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. and to assist in entering student scores.  Please contact Virginia Makepeace or Alison Nakaerts at 815-802-8750 if you can help out.<br></div></div></div>
