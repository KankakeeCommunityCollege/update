<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass058913DA86CD42478EC83C509A4B5C16"><p>The college has systematically been installing a “panic button “application on phones and computers throughout the college. There are two more phases of the program planned to fully complete the installations. </p>
<ul><li>Phase 1 (complete) - Used test sites to ensure the system would function as configured.</li>
<li>Phase 2 (complete) - Concentrated installations in major business centers, high traffic areas, and areas where the current phone system was capable of supporting the application. That phase constituted approximately 100 installations.</li>
<li>Phase 3: (to be complete by the end of the 2016 fall semester) - Install the software on an additional 300 work stations and phones for all staff and faculty. During phase three, the Information Technology Services Department, in conjunction with Public Safety will be conducting training and system installations. If you have questions about installation of the system in your area, or if you would like to request the installation at the earliest opportunity, please contact the <a href="mailto:helpdesk@kcc.edu">ITS help desk</a>.</li>
<li>Phase 4: Funding is being sought to purchase new phones for  classrooms. After funding is secured, installation of the new phones and the panic button system will be completed for all the classroom phones, podiums, or teaching station computers.</li></ul>
<p>If you are interested in expediting the panic button installation on your phone and/or computer, please email the Information Technology Services Helpdesk at <a href="mailto:helpdesk@kcc.edu">helpdesk@kcc.edu</a>.</p></div></div>
