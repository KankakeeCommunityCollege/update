<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassCC0E1F1F28A74151994156F2C81A50E5"><div>From exposing students to unforgettable college experiences to preparing them for college coursework, Upward Bound is a key element in helping students transition from high school to college.<br /></div>
<div>“Upward Bound helped me improve my study skills and prepped me for the ACT,” said Ron Addison, an Upward Bound student from 2007 to 2009. “It also exposed me to a college experience at a university and helped transition me from being with my family to being alone on a college campus. It helped me step away from my comfort zone.” <br /></div>
<div>Ron is a junior in the aviation technologies program at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. </div>
<div><br />“Upward Bound taught me the basic fundamentals of college such as good study skills and time management,” said Ron’s younger brother, Ryan, who was an Upward Bound student from 2010 to 2012. “Not only did it help me with school but it also helped me with meeting new people on campus.” He is a freshman at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y.</div>
<div><br />Ryan and Ron are just two of the many students who have joined UB for assistance. Each year the program offers services to 75 students from Kankakee High School and St. Anne Community High School.<br /></div>
<div>The program is designed to assist college bound high school students in overcoming barriers to pursuing a college education. <br /></div>
<div>“Upward Bound provides an array of services for students who are first generation and/or low income students,” said Jamal Hawkins, Upward Bound program director at KCC. “Services include ACT preparation, college tours, college planning, completion of college applications, scholarship searches, assistance with Free Application for Federal Student Aid completion and educational/cultural activities.”<br /></div>
<div>The program recently celebrated its 20th anniversary.</div>
<div><br />For more information, students can consult with their high school counselors and fill out an interest card. They can also visit the KCC website at <a href="/upwardbound">www.kcc.edu/upwardbound</a>, visit the campus and talk to an Upward Bound counselor, or contact Jamal at 815-802-8562.</div>
