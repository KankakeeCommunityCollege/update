<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass10C70DC2C3BF445B80DB2B2085846D26">
<div>The KCC Upward Bound program will continue its good works.</div>
<div><br />The program was recently re-funded by the United States Department of Education for five years.</div>
<div><br />Through KCC, Upward Bound provides support and academic assistance to high school students whose parents didn’t receive a baccalaureate degree or whose families meet specified income guidelines.</div>
<div><br />“The path to college can be challenging for many high school students whose family and friends have never been through the process,” said Jamal Hawkins, director of the Upward Bound program. “We work hard to ensure UB students take the necessary steps to enroll in a college that will ultimately contribute to their academic success. Plus, students take part in study skills and other academic preparation to earn the grades to be admitted.”</div>
<div><br />At KCC, the program is for students, ages 14 to 18, which are enrolled at Kankakee or St. Anne high schools.<br /></div>
<div>The program includes two main components. During the academic year portion, there are weekly sessions as well as occasional field trips and college visits. During the summer, the students take part in a three-week residential experience on the campus of Eastern Illinois University in Charleston. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>“The summer experience expands and enriches students’ academic preparation for college,” said Chris Young, assistant director of the Upward Bound program. “It allows them to experience a wide variety of subject matter and to use college facilities like the university library and science labs.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each summer, the group also takes an out-of-state trip, which includes college visits as well as cultural and historic sites.</div>
<div> </div>
