<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1A49E176CC1741AFB54C2C75163E55F7"><div>
<div>The KCC ALIVE Literacy program will be visiting local libraries to share information about volunteer tutoring opportunities. </div>
<div><br />Information will be available Tuesday, Feb. 19 at the Bradley Public Library; Friday, Feb. 22 at the Bourbonnais Public Library; Tuesday, Feb. 26 at the Kankakee Library and Wednesday, Feb. 27 at the Watseka Public Library. A representative will be at each location from 10-11 a.m. to answer questions about the program. </div>
<div><br />ALIVE volunteers assist adults with learning how to read or improving their basic skills in reading, writing, math and English. Once trained, volunteers meet with their students at locations convenient to both parties—such as local libraries, churches or community centers. The time commitment is one – two  hours per week. </div>
<div><br />The program serves adults in Kankakee and Iroquois counties. It is supported by the Secretary of State Literacy Office and United Way of Kankakee County.</div>
<div><br />For program information or training registration phone the KCC-ALIVE office at 815-802-8307 or email <a href="mailto:scarrell@kcc.edu">scarrell@kcc.edu</a>.<br /></div>
