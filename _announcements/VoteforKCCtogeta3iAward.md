<div> </div>
<div>Following is information about KCC's program provided within the nomination:</div>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 0pt;line-height:normal"><span></span> </p>
<div>KCC's integrates a market development component into its solar PV (photovoltaic) program. This component includes training local electrical inspectors in PV, partnering with U.S. equipment manufacturers, local installers, lenders and community organizations to support a local solar job market. An objective of KCC’s PV program is to positively impact local economies by helping overcome common barriers and developing a pipeline for students from underrepresented and minority groups.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Partnering with Illinois State University’s Solar for Schools program, KCC designed hands-on PV curriculum and lab equipment for 116 middle and high school students in 2013 and 2014. KCC views these schools as feeder schools for its renewable energy program. In addition, local outreach through ‘Power Hour’ presentations are open and free to the public.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC has partnered with eight colleges in the Midwest to replicate the PV market development and training program. A replication guide has been completed and KCC and the MREA (Midwest Renewable Energy Association) deliver workshops on the process at Solar Powering Your Community conferences.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On July 7, 2014, Gov. Pat Quinn visited KCC to announce funding from the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to build a renewable energy center at KCC. The 21,000 square foot facility will provide training in wind generation, solar thermal, PV systems and the National Electric Code. The addition is being designed to meet or exceed requirements for the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) Gold certification.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Currently, about 40 students receive training annually from KCC’s renewable energy program, but that number is expected to increase substantially with the new facility.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC already trains wind and solar technicians and hosts information sessions for the community as part of a grant received from the National Science Foundation. The new ATEC (Advanced Technology Education Center) will also train technicians and electricians who are already in the profession.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC has a long-term relationship with the advisory committee for the Electrical Technology program that has strong ties to local and state organizations and businesses. KCC’s <a href="/res/Pages/default.aspx">renewable program website</a> offers a job board for employers to post openings and a student to post resumes.</div>
