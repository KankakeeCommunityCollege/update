<div><font size="2">“Car Talk,” one of the most popular shows on public radio is coming to Kankakee.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />The show will cruise onto the WKCC 91.1 FM airwaves beginning March 16, and will air Saturdays from 9-10 a.m. and Sundays from 1-2 p.m.</div>
<div><br />Produced by NPR, Car Talk features Tom and Ray Magliozzi (aka Click and Clack the Tappet Brothers) sharing useful information on the care and maintenance of automobiles.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />“The addition of NPR’s signature entertainment program to our schedule gives WKCC arguably one of the strongest schedules of any public radio station,” said Mike Savage, WKCC’s director and general manager. “Kankakee area listeners will really enjoy the show’s humor and information,” Savage said.</div>
<div><br />Car Talk has put the spotlight under the hood of auto issues for more than 25 years. It now features material each week produced from those shows. Car Talk won a Peabody Award for broadcasting excellence in 1992. The Peabody award website says the show would be more appropriately named &quot;Zen and the Art of Automobile Maintenance.&quot;</font></div><font size="2">
