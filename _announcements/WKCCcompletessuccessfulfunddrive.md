<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass24D36B29DF9944A0BD077B49218283B3"><p>​WKCC raised nearly $15,000 during its Fall Fund Drive, which concluded Friday.</p>
<p>As of 4 p.m. on Dec. 12, the drive had brought in $14, 329. The recipient of the drawing for lunch or dinner with John Avendano was Ken Kesicki, a tutor for the Learning Services Department.</p>
<p>WKCC holds on air membership drives twice a year, in December and May. Listener-supporters offset the costs for WKCC to offer programming such as NPR News, A Prairie Home Companion, The Takeaway and CarTalk. Classical music, jazz, blues, and several locally produced programs also are aired on WKCC.</p>
<p>WKCC is the only full-service public radio station in the Kankakee area. It relies on underwriting and member support. The station is licensed to KCC and can be heard throughout Kankakee County and in portions of Will, Grundy, Livingston, Ford, and Iroquois counties in Illinois and Newton and Lake counties in Indiana.<br /></p>
