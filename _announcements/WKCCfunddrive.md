<div><font size="2">As it celebrates five years of public radio programming in the community, WKCC 91.1 FM is holding its winter on-air membership campaign Nov. 30 through Dec. 7.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />“Listeners who support WKCC help pay for public radio programs like NPR hourly news, A Prairie Home Companion, classical music and locally produced jazz and blues programs,” said Mike Savage, WKCC director and general manager. “Individual donations are a very important source of income for the Kankakee area’s only public radio station.”</div>
<div><br />Through fundraising support, the station is able to purchase and share quality programming, Savage said. WKCC pays about $50,000 annually for public radio programs.</div>
<div><br />Donations are tax deductible and any contribution is welcome. To become a WKCC member or renew membership call 815-802-8230 or visit </font><a href="http://www.wkccradio.org/"><font size="2">www.wkccradio.org/</font></a><font size="2">.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />WKCC 91.1 FM is a non-commercial radio station and relies on underwriting and member support. The station is licensed to Kankakee Community College and can be heard throughout Kankakee County and in portions of Will, Grundy, Livingston, Ford, and Iroquois counties in Illinois and Newton and Lake counties in Indiana.</div>
