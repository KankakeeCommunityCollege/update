<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassCB1488D5BC924735B0E757BF1909F7B2"><p>​KCC will discontinue its broadcasts and other radio operations of WKCC 91.1 FM in December 2015.</p>
<p>Budget constraints and other educational priorities are behind the radio station ending.</p>
<p>“While we believe the station is a community asset, the college isn’t able to continue funding it,” said Dr. John Avendano, KCC president. “Recent enrollment declines, coupled with dwindling state support, make it essential for the college to direct its resources towards instructional and student needs.”</p>
<p>WKCC has public radio programming, classical music and locally produced jazz, blues, and Beatles music shows, as well as Reel Focus, an independent film review show. </p>
<p>“We hope that our show producers at ‘Friends of the Blues,’ ‘Magical Mystery Tour,’ ‘Reel Focus’ and ‘In a Mellow Tone’ will continue to create their shows for distribution online and through other station broadcasts,” said Avendano.</p>
<p>Friends of the Blues is already syndicated and heard on more than 15 radio stations across the country and the Magical Mystery Tour Beatles Show is distributed online and broadcasted internationally. </p>
<p>“Other favorite public radio shows can be downloaded as podcasts from the shows’ websites and listened to at your convenience,” Avendano said.<br />WKCC relied on contributors, members and underwriters for part of its financial support.</p>
<p>“I want our supporters to know that their generosity was greatly appreciated,” said Avendano. “Because of their support and listenership we offered vibrant and intellectual programming for more than seven years. We began the station knowing it could enhance learning in our community. We hope your lives were enriched as much as ours were.”</p>
<p>Anyone with questions or concerns can contact Jonathan Coke, coordinator and general manager of WKCC, at 815-802-8233 or <a href="mailto:jcoke@kcc.edu">jcoke@kcc.edu</a>. </p>
<p>Through December, the station can be heard at 91.1 FM and online at <a href="http://www.wkccradio.org/">www.wkccradio.org/</a>. It can be heard throughout Kankakee County and in portions of Will, Grundy, Livingston, Ford and Iroquois counties in Illinois and Newton and Lake counties in Indiana.</p>
<p>WKCC began as WTKC, the nation’s first tourism radio station in 1992, as a partnership with Olivet Nazarene University and the Kankakee County Convention and Visitors Bureau. KCC assumed the operation and maintenance of the frequency in 2005. Plans for the station license have not been decided.</p>
