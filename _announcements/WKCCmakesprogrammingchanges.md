<div> </div>
<div><strong>Return to the Source - Fridays at Midnight<br /></strong>Hosted by Doug Turner, &quot;Return to the Source&quot; provides three hours of classic jazz selections that you would expect from a straight-ahead jazz show, and more. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>A Way with Words – Saturday at 11 a.m.<br /></strong>A Way with Words is an hour-long, call-in about language and how we use words. Martha Barnette and Grant Barrett take calls about slang, grammar, old sayings, word origins, regional dialects, family expressions, and speaking and writing well. By looking at the world through the lens of language, A Way with Words offers a new perspective on politics, pop culture, history, sports, music, science, literature, and foreign cultures. </div>
<div><br /><strong>Humankind – Saturday at 2 p.m.<br /></strong>This hour-long series profiles humanitarians, idealists and visionaries, hosted by award-winning documentary producer David Freudberg. Hear stories of citizens who inspire and motivate us by their courage.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The rebroadcast of <strong>In a Mellow Tone</strong> with Willie Dixon Jr. moves to 11 p.m. Friday evening. The first airing of In a Mellow Tone is at 7 p.m. Fridays.</div>
