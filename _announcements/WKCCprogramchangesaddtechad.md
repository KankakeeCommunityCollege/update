<div>Based on listener feedback, WKCC is changing its programming at noon each day, beginning Monday June 13.</div>
<div><br><font color="#000080"><strong>Mondays at noon, “The State We’re In”<br></strong></font>Taking the broadest view of human rights, the State We're In will inform, analyze, and discuss the issues without making moral judgments. The show will be the authority on human rights for public radio, covering events large and small that matter to listeners; stories that illuminate both human tragedies and successes around the world.</div>
<div><br><font color="#000080"><strong>Tuesdays at noon, “Travel with Rick Steves” <br></strong></font>This fun, hour-long, practical talk show features expert guests and questions from travelers. The show is a lively conversation between travelers and experts as we learn to explore our world smartly, smoothly, and thoughtfully. Travel with Rick Steves can also be heard Sundays at 11 a.m.</div>
<div><br><font color="#000080"><strong>Wednesdays at noon, “Tech Nation”<br></strong></font>Tech Nation is hosted by Dr. Moira Gunn, a former NASA scientist and engineer. She focuses on the impact of technology in America today. Each week features an interview, a commentary and a BioTech Nation segment, including the BioIssue of the Week. </div>
<div><br><font color="#000080"><strong>Thursdays at noon, “The Changing World”<br></strong></font>The Changing World presents stories which cover a variety of international issues, global trends and world events. Each program examines a specific topic in-depth, such as new directions in science, the role of NGOs worldwide, the politics of clean water, and the complexities of sustainable development.</div>
<div><br><font color="#000080"><strong>Fridays at noon, “This American Life”<br></strong></font>This American Life documents and describes contemporary America, but it is, quite literally, a new kind of radio storytelling. Built around the innovative personal vision of host Ira Glass, the program explores a weekly theme. The stories are engaging, intimate, surprising, funny, disturbing, and bittersweet. Listeners praise the show as &quot;riveting and mesmerizing.&quot; This American Life also can be heard Saturdays at noon.</div></div></div>
