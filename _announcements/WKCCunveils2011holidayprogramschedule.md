Marla Spivak, a University of Minnesota researcher and MacArthur &quot;Genius&quot; who thinks like a bee, will share insight into these fascinating insects.

<div><br /><strong>Giving Thanks with John Birge<br /></strong>Thursday, Nov. 24 -- 5 p.m.; With music and stories for Thanksgiving, host John Birge creates a thoughtful, contemporary reflection on the meaning of the holiday. Giving Thanks provides the perfect atmosphere for Thanksgiving: the warmth of great music, and truly memorable words. This year's selections include the world premiere performance of Table Grace, Matthew Brown's choral setting of a grace by Garrison Keillor, sung by VocalEssence. Between the music, it will be a contemporary celebration of the spirit of gratitude. </div>
