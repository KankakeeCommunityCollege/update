<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass6AD14628E85740A8AD84D7A1FDAB2F13"><p>WKCC 91.1 FM is offering three Thanksgiving-themed specials on Thursday, Nov. 27.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;The Splendid Table,&quot;</strong> from 10 a.m. - noon, has helpful information for Thanksgiving cooks, kitchen helpers and dinner guests. Lynne Rossetto Kasper, award-winning host of public radio's national food show, &quot;The Splendid Table,&quot; will be available to answer listener questions throughout the live program. Past shows have included everything from a cross-country trucker cooking his Thanksgiving dinner on the manifold to a panicked first-time cook who didn't realize a turkey needs to be thawed. Rossetto Kasper handles all questions with wit, expertise and laughter.</p>
<p>From noon - 1 p.m., the station will air <strong>&quot;Thanksgiving with Cantus.&quot;</strong> Members of Cantus, a premiere men's vocal ensemble, will talk with host Alison Young about the holiday, music and food. This year's special presentation will focus on the importance of heritage, including works from the Sacred Harp, Lakota Wiyanki by Herrington/Woodside and is the premiere of Psalm of the Soil, by Sarah Kirkland Snider. </p>
<p>Then, from 1-3 p.m., WKCC will air <strong>&quot;Giving Thanks 2014: Maya Angelou &amp; Nikki Giovanni.&quot;</strong> The program will have music and stories for Thanksgiving. Host John Birge will also offer a thoughtful, contemporary reflection on the meaning of the holiday. </p>
<p>The program also will celebrate the life of Maya Angelou, who passed away in May 2014, with her Thanksgiving blessing and memories. Author Nikki Giovanni will also read food poems from her new book, and recall the Thanksgiving she got kicked out of college.</p>
