<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassBAF84A7F063A4D74A75E53B9A1ACDF4B"><p style="color:darkblue">Submitted by Francesca Catalano, associate dean of the Math, Science and Engineering Division</p>
<p>KCC hosted the regional 2017 WYSE – <a href="https://wyse.engineering.illinois.edu/">Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering</a> – Academic Challenge on Feb. 7. We had 163 students from 11 local high schools competing in seven different subject areas. The top teams and top individuals in each subject advance to the sectional WYSE competition at North Central College in March. And without further ado the  high schools which won awards were:</p>
<p><strong>300 Division</strong><br />First Place: Grant Park H.S. (Grant Park also swept all the individual student awards in the chemistry test!)<br />Second Place: St. Anne Community H.S. <br />Third Place: Tri-Point H.S. </p>
<p><strong>700 Division</strong><br />First Place: Herscher H.S.<br />Second Place: Reed-Custer H.S.<br />Third Place: Manteno H.S.</p>
<p>The 1500 and unlimited divisions each only had one high school competing (Kankakee H.S. and Bradley-Bourbonnais Community H.S. respectively) so only individual student awards were given out.</p>
<p>I would like to express my gratitude to all the people and departments from around campus that helped make the competition a success. Alison Nakaerts has spent months planning and organizing the event; many thanks for all your hard work! Thank you, too to Dr. John Avendano, Mike Caparula, Virginia Dahl, Holly Gilliam, Dr. Jessica Greminger, Connor Jumonville, Kelly Myers, Sheila Pfaff, Joshua Schroeder, Terese Roberson, Dr. Melissa Weston, and SaVannah Worth.</p>
<p>Finally, gratitude to those people and departments that contributed from behind the scenes: the Athletic Department, Arena Food Services, Information Technology Services, Media, Marketing, the Foundation and Physical Plant Department.</p>
<p>It would not have been possible for KCC to host this event without the willingness of all these people to share their time and effort—thank you for once again helping to make WYSE a huge success!</p></div></div>
