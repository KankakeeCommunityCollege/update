<p>About 180 students from 12 local high schools will be competing; the students will be at KCC from 8:30 a.m. until around 2 p.m.</p>
<p>The Academic Challenge is a battery of tests created by the Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering program and offered to high school students. Subjects tested are biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering graphics, English, mathematics and physics. The goal of the Academic Challenge is to acquaint high school students with the course content and the level of competition that they will experience upon entering a college or university level science or engineering curriculum. Consequently, the test content will challenge the brightest students. </p>
<p>The KCC Foundation will be awarding 12 tuition waivers based on competition results.<br /></p></div></div>
