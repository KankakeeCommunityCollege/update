<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass57DD5C64253047B0900B96F1612AC58C"><p>On Tuesday, Feb. 7, KCC will host the 2017 regional <a href="https://wyse.engineering.illinois.edu/">WYSE – Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering</a> – Academic Challenge.</p>
<p>Approximately 165 students from 11 local high schools will be competing. The students will be on campus from 8:30 a.m. - 2 p.m.</p>
<p>The Academic Challenge is a battery of tests created by the Worldwide Youth in Science and Engineering program and offered to high school <br />students.</p>
<p>Subjects tested are biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering graphics, English, mathematics and physics. The goal of the Academic Challenge is to acquaint high school students with the course content and the level of competition that they will experience upon entering a science or engineering curriculum at the college or university level. Consequently, the test content will challenge the brightest students.</p>
