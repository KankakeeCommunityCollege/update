<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC7C2A52CEA3A492E9C5308799425B71B"><p>​Since the installation of its first bottle filling station in July 2012, KCC bottle filling stations have dispensed the equivalent of 31,868 bottles of water.</p>
<p>In essence, said Bert Jacobson, Ph.D. dean of environmental and institutional sustainability, each fill has saved a disposable plastic bottle from going to the landfill.</p>
<p>Usage at the six filling stations has equaled 8,413 gallons.</p>
<p>KCC currently has water bottle filling stations on the Riverfront Campus first floor near the Iroquois Room, first floor of the Technology Building, third floor Arts &amp; Sciences Building, third floor Workforce Development Center and West Campus; and at the North Extension Center. </p>
<p>The most popular location is on the third floor Arts &amp; Sciences Building, with 10,725 bottles filled.</p>
