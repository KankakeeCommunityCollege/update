<p>On Saturday, June 7, the deck over the retention pond at KCC was the site of the nuptials of KCC Professor Bob Ling and his new wife, Tanya (Papineau). The couple's youngest sons’, Conner and Ryder, served as ring bearers and the older sons (Gavin and Brayden) gave the bride away.<br /> <br />Barring other evidence, it is the first wedding ever held on the KCC grounds.<br /> <br />Bob is a professor in the Math, Science and Engineering Division. Congratulations to Bob and Tanya!</p></div>
