<div> </div>
<div>If we can get 15 people to commit, the Weight Watchers At-Work program will return to KCC.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Meetings would be held on Tuesdays from 12:15-12:45 p.m. in Room L279.</div>
<div><br />Since the start of the Weight Watchers At-Work program at KCC, more than 55 employees have committed to become more healthy. As a result, more than 1,000 pounds have collectively been shed.</div>
<div><br />The cost of the 12-week series is $156, but KCC (as a wellness initiative) would pay 25% of the cost ($39) while employees would pay $117. Payroll deduction is available. Sign-up deadline is 5 p.m. on Friday, Sept. 28.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are interested in joining, or if you have any questions, please contact David Cagle at 815-802-8128 or email <a href="mailto:dcagle@kcc.edu">dcagle@kcc.edu</a>.</div>
