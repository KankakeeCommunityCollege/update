<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClass1A23AF6D90C24EF18B34DD10A603B90C><div><font size=2>From: Submitted by David Cagle, director of human resources, and coordinator of concierge services for employees</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>Wow â€“ does Jennifer Hudson look amazing or what? What was her secret to her weight loss? You guessed it - Weight Watchers! </div>
<div><br>If you want the same kind of weight loss success as Jennifer Hudson, please come to one of the open houses that are scheduled for the next two Tuesdays, March 8 and March 15, from 12:15 to 12:45 p.m in Room L279. </div>
<div><br>The next series at KCC begins on Tuesday, March 22. </div>
<div><br>If 15 and 19 people register, it will be a 14-week program for $126 per participant. The cost is reduced from the standard $168 rate because KCC will pay $42 of the fee for each employee who takes part.</div>
<div><br>If 20 or more people register, it will be a 17-week program with free e-tools. The reduced rate cost will be $140 for each employee, and KCC will pay $46 of the $186 enrollment fee. </div>
<div><br>The current group of participants has lost more than 127 pounds since Nov. 30. We need more participants in order to continue with the program. So far, only eight staff and faculty have committed.&quot;</div>
<div><br>Please contact David by e-mail or at 815-802-8128 for more information.<br></div></font></div></div>
