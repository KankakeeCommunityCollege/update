<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClass3C5C2E9118D245A59D973713FB2E75EC"><p>​The Office of Student Life would like to thank everyone who volunteered at Welcome Back Week. <br />Laura Gardner said, “Without the generous donation of time and effort by KCC administrators, staff, faculty, and students, this event wouldn’t be successful. The sense of community provided on campus helps students feel connected to KCC.” </p>
