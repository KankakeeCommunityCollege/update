<div>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>Conversion from GroupWise to Microsoft Outlook 2007 will begin in February.</font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>After the conversion, the most visible change will be the icon on your desktop -- the &quot;mailbox&quot; in a postal analogy.</font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>Behind-the-scenes, the &quot;post office&quot; we use will be upgraded to a product called Microsoft Exchange.</font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>The Information Technology Services and Continuing Education &amp; Career Services offices are partnering to coordinate the training and behind-the-scenes functionality.</font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>Upon migration to Microsoft Exchange, we'll all be operating with the same Microsoft-based products on the same platform. One result is a significant cost savings to the college.</font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>At the training, instead of how to send an e-mail, you’ll learn… </font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>-- how sending an e-mail in Outlook looks different and is easier; </font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>-- how your GroupWise address books and calendars will convert into Outlook; </font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>-- how to use the great new features in Outlook that will make the transition seamless and fun!</font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>Training dates will soon be announced through Update. Please register for a workshop at that time. The workshops will run from 9 a.m. - 3 p.m., with 30 minutes for lunch. </font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>While you are in the training class, ITS will upgrade your machine. You'll be able to start using Outlook when you return to your office.</font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>The goal is to have all staff converted to Outlook by March 2011.</font></p>
<p dir=ltr><font size=2>Keep watching Update for more information on how and when to register! We hope to see you there!</font></p></div></div></div>
