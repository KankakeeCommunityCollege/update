<p>Professor Tim Wilhelm of Kankakee Community College has received the 2013 Interstate Renewable Energy Council 3i Award in the category of Clean Energy Trainer of the Year.</p>
<p></font><font size="2">The award honors excellence in clean energy education and training.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">“IREC is the gold standard in renewable energy program accreditation and instructor certification,” Wilhelm said. “This, to me, is one of the highest honors an instructor in our field could possibly receive.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2">At KCC Wilhelm is coordinator of the Electrical Technology Program, and he teaches courses topics including National Electric Code, Solar-Thermal Technology, Small-Wind Technology and Solar-Photovoltaic Technology.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Wilhelm was instrumental in KCC receiving a grant from the National Science Foundation to train students for careers in renewable energy and create partnerships with employers who offer renewable energy products. As more employers offer renewable energy products, positions for installers and technicians become available.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">A cooperating contractor for the grant program is Keast Electric Inc.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">“It amazes me how passionate Tim is about renewable energy and learning,” said Doug Keast, a union journeyman electrician with Keast Electric. “He wants students to be aware of the new facets of the industry which are coming around and which will eventually be the standard. Because he is on the front line, he is always sharing the next thing.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Keast enrolled in a KCC solar photovoltaic course to become certified to install solar products.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">“There was a lot of information to absorb, but Tim’s attitude and the way he presents the material make you want to learn,” he said. “As soon as class began, it always felt as if we were about to undertake some grand adventure. I’m fortunate to have had him as an instructor.”</font></p>
<p><font size="2">Wilhelm aligns KCC’s advanced renewable energy courses with the industry’s measures of competence. The solar photovoltaic course prepares students for the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners PV entry level exam. The Spring 2011 class had a 92 percent pass rate on the North American Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP) photovoltaic entry-level exam.</font></p>
<p><font size="2">“I really liked his lectures and how he was able to relate classwork to real world situations,” said Clayton McDowell, a wind field service technician for GE. “He’s the reason I switched my major to renewable energy. The environment in his classes brought everyone together.”</font></p>

<p>Wilhelm is involved in a number of initiatives related to renewable energy and education. One of them is a partnership with Illinois Green Economy Network and the Midwest Renewable Energy Association. Through a program called Power Pack Kankakee, KCC and the other agencies are supporting U.S. manufacturers of solar hardware, working with lending agencies, and building a customer base for local solar installers through education and free solar site assessments.</p>
<p>“What places Professor Wilhelm above the rest as an instructor are his years of experience in the field and also the amount of partnering he does within the community and renewable energy industry leaders locally, regionally and from around the world,” said Jennifer Martin, a colleague of Wilhelm’s who wrote his award nomination. “He is deeply committed to the success of his students, the electrical technology program at KCC and the advancement of renewable energy technology in the state of Illinois.”</p>
<p>Clay Sterling, a Regional Training Officer for the Midwest Renewable Energy Association also was named a trainer of the year. Wilhelm and Sterling received their awards during a ceremony on Tuesday, Oct. 22 at the Solar Power International Conference in Chicago. IREC is a non-profit organization that works to expand consumer access to clean energy; generates information and objective analysis grounded in best practices and standards; and leads programs to build a quality clean energy workforce, including a unique credentialing program for renewable energy and energy efficiency training providers and instructors. Since 1982, IREC's programs and policies have benefitted energy consumers, policymakers, utilities and the clean energy industry. As of July 2013, IREC is an accredited American National Standards Developer.</p>
