<div>The Information Technology Services Department and Office of Continuing Education and Career Services have been compiling information and preparing for the transition to Windows 7.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Their preparation for the deployment of Windows 7 has included compiling results from the Windows 7 needs assessment, meeting with users to address concerns and answer questions during focus groups, establishing a Windows 7 beta team as early adopters of the new operating system, implementing an online training solution, remediating hardware issues, assessing software compatibility, and completing the Windows 7 training curriculum.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To date, the ITS Department has migrated 10% of KCC employees to Windows 7.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A list is being created of those interested in moving to the new operating system before the training is offered. To get on the list, phone ITS at 815-802-8900 and ask to be placed on the Windows 7 migration list.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As implied above, training is not required to be upgraded to Windows 7. It is, however, strongly encouraged so as to leverage many of the new features this operating system has to offer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Windows 7 training will be offered between Thursday, June 27 and Wednesday, July 31. </div>
<div> </div>
