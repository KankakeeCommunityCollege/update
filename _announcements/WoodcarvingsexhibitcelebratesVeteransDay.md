<p>I took a woodcarving class through the Boy Scouts at their downtown Chicago headquarters, and that piqued my interest. I had also built wooden model airplanes as a boy, and I was very mechanically inclined. Woodcarving became a hobby for me when I built our family home in Frankfort, where I hand-carved the fireplace mantel, various door plaques, and arched doorways. It was interesting to use themes like music and arts, hunting and fishing, and others as the basis for the woodcarvings. After I retired, I began to carve plaques for businesses, industries, schools, and other organizations. <br /><br /></p>
