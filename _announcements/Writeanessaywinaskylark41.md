<div><b>Body:</b> <div class=ExternalClassB6CF519CDC68448EBBC8BD589011840C><div> <font size=2>    For many years, the beautiful skylark sculpture has adorned the south patio at KCC.</font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    In the coming months, it will be replaced with &quot;Meridian IX&quot; a beautiful new sculpture.</div>
<div><br>    Skylark will have a new roost.</div>
<div><br>    Before it moves, you can write an essay and maybe win a used Buick Skylark! Or, a picture of a used Buick Skylark -- whichever costs less.</div>
<div><br>    The essay must: (1) describe in exactly 401 words why you will miss &quot;Skylark&quot;; (2) use the names of at least 41 bird types; and (3) be turned in at exactly 4:01 p.m. on Friday, April 1 to Elizabeth Becvar in Administration Hallway.</div>
<div><br>    If 41 people submit essays, a panel of judges will determine the winner of the Skylark (Car or picture? The suspense is tremendous!) If a different number of essays are turned in--even if they don't meet the essay requirements--the judges will award a consolation prize to someone.</div>
<div><br>    This isn't a lark ... it's a sky-lark! Ha</font>ppy writing. <br></div></div></div>
