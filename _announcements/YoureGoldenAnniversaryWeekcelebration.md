<div><b>Body:</b> <div class="ExternalClassD47D97B670254B19A91CAF024BBDBE80"><p><img alt="50logoWbanner.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/50logoWbanner.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />Don’t miss KCC's 50th Anniversary Week of celebrations from Oct. 3 to 6. Faculty, staff and students are invited to all events. </p>
<p>The college's official anniversary is Oct. 8, the date of its state charter. The Anniversary Week begins a series of events and activities which will culminate with a gala celebration on May 20, 2017. </p>
<p><strong>Monday, Oct. 3 - Mascot Monday</strong><br />A spirit rally will be at noon in the KCC College. Opportunities to “Capture the Cavalier” in a picture will be from 11 a.m. - 2 p.m., also in the College Center. Refreshments and other fun freebies will be offered from noon - 1 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday, Oct. 4 - Tell Your Story Tuesday</strong><br />KCC Alumni will tell their stories during sessions in the KCC Iroquois Room. From 8-9 a.m., a panel of law enforcement leaders will share their experiences. At 9:30 a.m., patrol officers will take part in a question and answer session. The stories will conclude with Kelly Edwards and Stephanie Rayman speaking about their choice to become a nurse and then a nursing professor. Edwards’ and Raymans' presentation will be from 3-3:30 p.m. Each Tell Your Story event will have refreshments available.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday, Oct. 5 - We Appreciate You Wednesday</strong><br />A Thank-You Brigade will travel throughout the college to share a potentially loud and boisterous display of gratitude. They will also share sweet treats with students. Additionally, Appreciation Hot-spots will pop up at various KCC locations, also offering treats and heaps of thank-you's. You can still volunteer for the Thank You Brigade – contact <a href="mailto:ebecvar@kcc.edu">Liz Becvar </a>for details.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday, Oct. 6 - Throwback Thursday</strong><br />Community members and alumni are encouraged to visit KCC for a reception from 5-7 p.m. on the South Patio at KCC. Refreshments – including a specially created KCC 50th anniversary cupcake from <a href="http://www.nanascookiesandmore.com/">Nana’s Cakery</a> – will be served.</p>

<p>Area businesses are celebrating with us, too. Locally-made sips and treats were created especially for KCC. There’s a unique cupcake at Nana's Cakery in Bradley and a special craft brew called Cavaliers ’66 at <a href="http://www.brickstonebrewery.com/">Brickstone Brewery</a>. The cupcakes and Cavaliers ‘66 will be served at the gala and selected events. Cavalier ‘66 is for sale at Brickstone Brewery in Bourbonnais, and the owners are establishing a KCC scholarship with the proceeds. </p>

The site also has a link for people to <a href="http://fifty.kcc.edu/contact/">share their stories and KCC memories</a>. Some event details are being added to the site as they are finalized. </p>
