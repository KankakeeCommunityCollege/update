<p>“I am always excited to see what the students have been working on over the course of the past year,” said Chelise Slowik, KCC art professor. “Overall, it is a beautiful display of our future local artists. It shows off the talent of not only these amazing high school students, but that of their gifted teachers as well.”</p>
<div>“This is a wonderful opportunity for students to see the work of their peers from other schools in the area,” said Jean Janssen, KCC art professor. “More importantly, students experience taking their work all the way to the finished presentation. There’s quite a thrill in that.”</div>
<div> </div>
