<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1E94FF316D3E4B46BFBD3066A22C557D"><p>​The community is invited to a groundbreaking ceremony for a new building to house KCC’s award-winning Electrical Technology program.</p>
<p>The groundbreaking for the Advanced Technological Education Center will be Tuesday, March 31 at 1 p.m. on the south lawn near the Technology Building. If the weather does not cooperate, the location will be the Hammes Cafe. There also will be remarks at 1:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The 21,000 square foot ATEC building will have classrooms, labs, offices, and support spaces to provide hands-on technical training in fields such as wind generation, solar thermal, solar photo-voltaic systems, and electrical (National Electric Code NEC) instruction. </p>
<p>The completed building will meet requirements for the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) Gold certification.</p>
<p>ATEC will be the second LEED Gold certified building for KCC. Buildings are assigned scores by the U.S. Green Building Council based upon their environmentally-friendly attributes. The building council looks at the facility comprehensively, considering site issues, water efficiency, energy efficiency, materials use and indoor environmental quality.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bldd.com/">BLDD Architects</a> of Chicago is the architect, and <a href="http://piggushsimoneauinc.com/">Piggush Simoneau, Inc.</a> of Kankakee will be the builder.</p>
<p>KCC offers an <a href="/future/choosing/occupational/electech/Pages/default.aspx">Electrical Technology</a> associate degree with a renewable energy technology specialization, for which the college received the Interstate Renewable Energy Council Accredited Clean Energy Training Provider of the Year award in 2014. The college also has short-term certificates in Small-Wind Technology, Solar PV Technology and Solar-Thermal Technology. Each of these short-term certificates is 21 credit hours and can be finished in less than two years of part-time enrollment.</p>
