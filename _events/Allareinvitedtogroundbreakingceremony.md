<div>All employees and the community are invited to a groundbreaking ceremony at 10:30 a.m. Wednesday, Oct. 17 for the new KCC North Extension Center at 450 N. Kinzie in Bradley.</div>
<div><br />Light refreshments will be served beginning at 10:30 a.m. and remarks will take place at 11 a.m.</div>
<div><br />The groundbreaking will be for a new KCC facility at this location, where offerings will include credit division courses, corporate training, and adult education and GED preparation classes. The North Extension Center also will house KCC’s new massage therapy program. </div>
<div><br />“A component of KCC’s master plan is to locate a facility in the northern part of the college’s district,” said John Avendano, KCC president. “The master plan was developed through discussions with community and business leaders, area school administrators, our own staff and others.”</div>
<div><br />The two-story building will have 18,353 square feet of space, including a computer lab, testing room, literacy room, conference room, five classrooms, three instructional rooms for the massage therapy program, and staff offices. Total cost of the project is estimated at $5.2 million. </div>
<div><br />Construction is expected to begin this fall, and completion is anticipated in fall 2014.<br /></div>
