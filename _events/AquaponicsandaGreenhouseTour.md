<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClassBE242AF14D8D4FBCBC3BEEDE62CA0C5C"><p>​This Sustainability Week event, &quot;Aquaponics and a Greenhouse Tour&quot; will be presented by a KCC student, Linda Nitz-Mercaeant, and Professor Katelynn Ohrt from 2-3:30 p.m. Wednesday, April 22. The tour will begin in Room VA03 on West Campus.</p>
<p><strong>Event description: </strong>Aquaponics is a food production system that combines conventional aquaculture (in KCC’s case, raising tilapia in tanks) with hydroponics (cultivating plants in water) in a symbiotic environment. In an aquaponic system, water from an aquaculture system is fed to a hydroponic system where the by-products are broken down by nitrification bacteria into nitrates and nitrites, which are utilized by the plants as nutrients. The water is then recirculated back to the aquaculture system. Come hear Linda Nitz-Mercaeant and Professor Katelynn Ohrt describe our aquaponic system and tour the greenhouse where the system is working.</p>
<p>This is one of a number of FREE Sustainability Week events being offered at KCC from April 20 to 24. <br /><br />***<br /><a href="/update">Go to Online Update</a><br /></p></div>
