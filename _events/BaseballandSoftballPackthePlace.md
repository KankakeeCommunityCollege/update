<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1F31593F805049E7B5F2351A4C5773C2"><p>​“Wear your “Scarlet Fever” T-shirt, show your school pride, and support our Cavaliers as they compete against Prairie State College (softball at 3 p.m.) and Triton College (baseball, also at 3 p.m.). <br /><br />Don’t have a “Scarlet fever” T-shirt? The main information desk on the first floor will be selling them one week before the event for $5. T-shirts also will be sold at the game. Free refreshments will be offered while supplies last. Free admission. Don’t miss the action-packed fun!”<br /><br />To show support for Cavaliers baseball and softball March 25, employees are invited to wear a Scarlet Fever T-shirt to work, with jeans or other slacks. Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded. Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans and/or a Scarlet Fever T-shirt. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, they may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college.</p>
