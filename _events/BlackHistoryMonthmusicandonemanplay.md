<div>On Monday, Feb. 6, KCC will celebrate Black History Month with musical performaces by Chapman's Trio and a one-man play.<br /> <br />The events are free and the public is invited. The schedule is:<br /> <br />Music ensemble, Chapman’s Trio, Cavalier Room - 6 p.m,<br />One-man play, Incognito, Auditorium - 7 p.m.<br />Music ensemble, Chapman’s Trio, Cavalier Room. - 8 p.m. (Light refreshments will follow the performance)<br /> <br />Incognito is the story of Michael Fosberg’s personal journey begun nearly 20 years ago when he learned he was part African-American.<br /> <br />The discovery began with his mother’s divorce from the man he’d grown up calling ‘Dad,’ a man who adopted him when he was 5. The sudden change of circumstance propelled him to find his biological father. During this first phone conversation, his father cautiously revealed that he was African-American. Fosberg has now discovered the roots of his rich African-American heritage dating back to slavery.<br /> <br />Incognito is Fosberg's one-man play and recently published memoir about finding his father/himself, about race and deception of skin color, about family and history, about the loss of childhood, about secrets, about forgiveness, and about the courage of his then-young mother to persist in finding a way to raise him. It is a life-changing self-discovery of family and race, a personal historical odyssey revealing slavery on both sides of his family in two opposite sides of the world.</div>

<div>Members of Chapman’s Trio are from the Pembroke/Hopkins Park area. Each man got his start in music playing in church and the local elementary school band.</div>
<div>The group has been playing together for several years at different occasions.</div>
<div>“The weird thing was we never get together to formally practice together, but when we would get together, we knew each other’s style so well, until everyone assumed that we spend hours in formal rehearsals,” said group member Ken Crite. “Gospel musicians have been our greatest influence, which is the root of all of the other styles that we play.”</div>
<div>Chapman’s Trio plays a variety of music including gospel, R&amp;B, blues and jazz.</div>
<div>Robert Chapman received formal training from VanderCook College of Music in Chicago. The other two musicians, Raphael Smyly and Crite graduated from Jarvis Christian College in Texas.<br />Visit <a href="/directions">www.kcc.edu/directions</a> for maps and directions.</div></div>
