<div> </div>
<div>A first-hand witness to the rise of the Civil Rights Movement, Boone was raised in Drew, Miss. during the turbulent late 1950s, and early 60s. </div>
<div> </div>

<div>Through it all, Boone struggled to find her way, but was hindered by her own set of family secrets, such as who her birth parents are and why the other members of her family never talk about them except in hushed whispers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After traveling north to escape the problems and poverty of Mississippi, Boone found herself trapped in a brutal cycle of spousal abuse and covert racism. Eventually, she was out on the street with her young children, limited resources and no friends. Boone realized she must adapt and overcome or die.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now, with adult children and grandchildren, she feels it is time to re-address the problems that still exist as a result of bigotry. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>God and family are her priorities. Diana is happily married for 28 years. They have learned that all human relationships take second place to their Creator, God, and Savior Jesus Christ. As Diane would tell you, “No human being is better than another, and no man is an island.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“Growing Up Black in the Jim Crow South” is the remarkable and uplifting story of her step-by-step climb out of the ghetto, and her eventual quest to find out the truth about her own family secrets. Diana Boone is a role model not only for her generation, but for all young, Black women as well.</div>
