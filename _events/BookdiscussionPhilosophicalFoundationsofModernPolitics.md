<div><font size="2">The community is invited to join three KCC professors for a book discussion series on the philosophical foundations of modern politics.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><a href="/Documents/Phil-found-book-discussion-2014.pdf"><font size="2">View a flier about the book series.</font></a></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">The session on Jan. 22 will be &quot;Leviathan,&quot; by Thomas Hobbes, Part One, Chapters XIII-XIV. This reading material is available for free in the KCC Hammes Bookstore.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The professors leading the discussions are Steve DePasquale, Scott Kistler and Kenneth West.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“This semester, we are looking at some 17th- and 18th-century thinkers who set the tone for modern American and European politics,” Kistler said. “All of them took a secular approach to politics. They had different views of human nature, and they sought to justify different political arrangements.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“The issues raised in these books are relevant today: What form of government best ensures order and freedom? What is the basis of government’s powers, and what rights do citizens have? How should countries relate to each other on the international stage? These authors raise important questions and answer them in ways that have proven to be very influential.”</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Depasquale also said there are many questions to be answered. </font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“It’s a constant struggle for people to figure out the best system of government to have and the best way to organize their societies,” he said. “We have our way here in America. But is it the best way? The only way? We can all use as many perspectives on these questions as possible.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“I enjoy doing these discussions because I’m gaining different insights into various political and social theories.”</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Each session of the reading series will be 2:30-3:30 p.m. in KCC Room L315. After Jan. 22, the remaining sessions are: </font></div>
