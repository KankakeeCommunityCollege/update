Most devastatingly, her ability to speak has also been taken. Although difficult at times, Bonnie has maintained her spirit and sense of humor.<br /><br />Despite the challenges of the disease itself, there are many other challenges that Bonnie and her husband, Evan, face -- including financial burdens. Evan is an adult probation officer for Kankakee County and an adjunct professor at KCC, teaching Criminal Justice courses. Although they have insurance, not everything is covered. The consumables Bonnie needs for tube-feeding and bi-pap breathing machine alone are enormous. They will continue to increase as the disease progresses.<br /></p>
<p>Bonnie’s family and friends are hosting a benefit on Saturday, Nov. 4, <br /><img alt="Bowling for Bonnie.png" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/bowling-for-bonnie-med.png" style="height:100px;width:305px;vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" />2017 at the <a href="http://brookmontbowlingcenter.com/">Brookmont Bowling Center</a> from 4-8 p.m. to help raise funds to assist Bonnie and Evan.
