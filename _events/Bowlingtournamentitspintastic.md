<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1F66860C503D4ABE8DA5DB09B258799E"><p>​ <img alt="bowlpin.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/bowlpin.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />The first-ever KCC bowling tournament will roll along the college hallways beginning at 4 p.m. Friday, April 1.</p>
<p>In brief, here's how it works:</p>
<ul><li>Choose any hallway at KCC which is 41 feet or longer, and a maximum of 4 feet, 1 inch wide. </li>
<li>Only officially approved and licensed &quot;spongy&quot; equipment will be allowed.</li>
<li>Score sheets can be picked up from Linda Chouinard in the Bookstore at 11:50 a.m. This means pick them up <strong>at</strong> 11:50 a.m. April 1. Don't be late. Or early.</li>
<li>Spongy bowling balls and mini-pins can be borrowed if you pick them up at 3:57 p.m. at the first floor receptionist desk, on April 1. Pick them up <strong>at</strong> 3:57 p.m. Don't be late. Or early. </li>
<li>If you choose a curved hall, you'll get to borrow bowling shoes, too.</li>
<li>Knock on all doors in the hallway before beginning. Provide each occupant with a 41-second monologue on how &quot;turkey&quot; became a bowling term.</li>
<li>All bowling must cease at 4:10 p.m. so the equipment can be shipped to the <a href="http://www.bowl.com/">United States Bowling Congress</a> for authentication.</li></ul>
<p>A 41-page rule book is availble upon request. To be part of the official results, turn in scores by 4:10 p.m. to Elizabeth Becvar in the Marketing Department. Liz will only evaluate the first 41 score sheets, so be prompt.</p>
<p>Enjoy!<br /></p></div></div>
