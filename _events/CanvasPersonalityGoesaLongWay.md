<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass097962E7E317404097D6FE3598D6C6B6"><p>​​The Instructional Technology Office is offering a variety of sessions to help faculty and staff get acquainted with Canvas, the new learning management system. <br /><br />The session on Thursday, Nov. 19 in Room L253 from Noon - 1 p.m. is Canvas: Personality Goes a Long Way. Did you know that instructor presence in an online course is the single, most important factor in determining a student’s success and satisfaction? Frequent feedback, regular announcements, timely correspondence with students are just some indicators of teacher presence, but it doesn't necessarily guarantee it. In this session, the Canvas Network team will share creative ways to sprinkle your personality into your courses so students can connect with you -- and not the robot teacher in a dark room somewhere.<br /><br />Please reserve a space by emailing the date and time of the session you will attend to <a href="mailto:canvashelp@kcc.edu">canvashelp@kcc.edu</a>. A list of all TLC events is on the <a href="/FacultyStaff/departments/ktlc/Pages/tlc-calendar.aspx">TLC calendar.</a><br /> </p></div></div>
