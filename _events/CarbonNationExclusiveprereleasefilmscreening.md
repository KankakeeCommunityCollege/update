<div><font size=2>Carbon Nation will premiere in New York City on Feb. 11, but you can view it Jan. 25.</font></div>
<div><font size=2></font> </div>
<div><font size=2>Kankakee is privileged to have acquired this film for a public screening.</font></div>
<div><font size=2></font> </div>
<div><font size=2>Carbon Nation is a documentary about climate change solutions. You don’t have to believe in climate change to want solutions for such issues as clean air and dependency on foreign oil.</font></div>
<div><font size=2></font> </div>
<div><font size=2>This film provides an optimistic discovery of what people are already doing, what we as a nation could be doing, and what the world needs to do to prevent or slow down the impending climate crisis. It points out that we already have the technology to combat most of the worst case scenarios of climate change, and it is very good business as well with the economic opportunities that new “green” markets present. Being green is a win/win situation. </font></div>
<div><font size=2></font> </div>
<div><font size=2>The director of Carbon Nation, Peter Byck, said he wanted to make a big-tent film where folks of all political stripes could find common ground.  </font></div>
<div><font size=2></font> </div>
<div><font size=2>The film is free, but donations will be accepted to help defray the cost of the film. Seating will be on a first-come first-served basis. Carbon Nation was shown in Chicago’s Millennium Park last summer to an audience of 1,800 people. </font></div>
<div><font size=2></font> </div>
<div><font size=2>The event is part of the monthly Green Happenings Series presented by the partnership of the KCC Council for Community Sustainability and the Kankakee Public Library.</font></div></div></div></div>
