<div>On Friday, July 8, KCC employees can dress casually.</div>
<div><br>Employees may wear jeans if they choose to.</div>
<div><br>Standard casual day guidelines apply: <br>    - Participation is optional. <br>    - Jeans may be worn if accompanied by a collared shirt with &quot;Kankakee Community College&quot; on it or if accompanied by a business casual shirt and a KCC name badge or staff ID. KCC shirts are sold at the Hammes Bookstore and a limited selection is available in marketing and public information. Prices vary at both locations.  <br>    - Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded. <br>    - Those who choose not to wear jeans should wear their normal work attire; or they can choose to wear a KCC collared shirt along with their normal attire. <br>    - All employee groups can participate. <br>    - Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college. <br><br>    Questions regarding this casual day should be directed to David Cagle, <a href="mailto:dcagle@kcc.edu">dcagle@kcc.edu</a>, director of human resources.<br></div></div></div>
