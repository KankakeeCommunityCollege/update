<div>On March 3, KCC Head Softball Coach Dennis Clark notched his 1,000th coaching victory.<br /></div>
<div>Dennis is in his 30th year as head coach. KCC will honor his 1,000th win on Thursday, March 22 with several events. There will be tailgating near the softball field beginning at 2:30 p.m. with free hot dogs and soft drinks. The Cavaliers play a double-header against Morton College beginning at 3 p.m. At 5:30 p.m. in the college’s Iroquois Room, there will be a reception with Dennis.<br /></div>
<div>The rain date is March 27.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“The time has flown by,” Dennis said. “I still love coaching. I’m really looking forward to the new season and new challenges. I can’t wait for March 2. Over the years there have been hundreds of different players who make this fun. When you have good players and good support, meaning my wife, assistant coaches and the college staff, it’s easy.&quot;</div>
<div><br />Clark’s 999th victory capped the 2011 season record of 49 wins, 11 losses, and earned the Cavaliers a third place finish in the nation. That followed up a second-place finish in the 2010 national tournament. For 2012, the Cavaliers hold the pre-season No. 2 rank in NJCAA Division II softball. </div>
<div><br />Since 1993, the Cavaliers softball team has made national tournament appearances 16 of 19 seasons. Only two other active NJCAA softball coaches have more victories than Clark. In all his years as head coach, Clark’s teams have not had a losing season.</div>

<div>In addition to head softball coaching duties, Dennis is director of the KCC Fitness Center. Before become head softball coach, he served as an assistant coach for three years. He also was an assistant coach for the Cavaliers men’s basketball team for 19 years.<br /> </div>
