<p>&quot;Every year, Phi Theta Kappa engages in a College Project to further improve the campus and environment here at KCC. This year, the club decided to inform the students and staff of the dangers of eating disorders. The NEDA (National Eating Disorders Association) week falls between Feb. 22 to 28. In order to spread awareness, on Wednesday, Feb. 25 members of Phi Theta Kappa will be handing out brochures, wristbands, and will have a banner for students and staff to sign in support.&quot;</p>
