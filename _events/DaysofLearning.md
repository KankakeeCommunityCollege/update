<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClassD9205039171A45DEB573F1F14D22B641"><p>​On Tuesday, March 10 all supportive staff members and administrators will be strongly encouraged to attend a &quot;Days of Learning&quot; session.<br /><br />Note: faculty also are invited, but it is realized that they are on spring break.</p>
<p>Two sessions will be offered, one from 9 a.m. - noon, and the other from 1-4 p.m. in the Iroquois Room, D152. <br /><br />The topic will be: &quot;Unleashing Excellence to Attract and Keep Students,&quot; presented by Teri Yanovitch, co-author of Unleashing Excellence - the Complete Guide to Ultimate Customer Service. She also is a former speaker and seminar leader for the Disney Institute.<br /><br />Since the college is not closed to the public these days, please arrange your attendance with your supervisor to stagger office coverage. Where possible, student workers and &quot;as-needed&quot; staff are suggested ways to cover work areas.<br /><br />Please plan on participating in lunch from noon - 1 p.m. in the Iroquois Room.</p>
