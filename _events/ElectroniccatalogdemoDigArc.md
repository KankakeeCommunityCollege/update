<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC3574FE7139A4D72951CBB97AF48C1B9"><p>​​​All employees are invited to web presentations from two finalists--SmartCatalog and DigArc--in the search for an electronic catalog vendor.</p>
<p>The Smart Catalog presentation will be 1:30-2:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 18 in Room D124. The DigArc presentation will be Thursday, March 19 from 4-5 p.m., also in Room D124.</p>
<p>The demos will focus on features of the electronic catalogs. The goals of offering an electronic catalog include:</p>
<p>• To provide students with a more accurate and streamlined catalog.<br />• Integration with other technologies such as the academic curriculum process, catalog production and Ellucian’s Collegue.<br />• Consistent, user-friendly navigation, and a search function capable of returning results for specific courses, programs, and other catalog content.<br />• The ability to print any page without unnecessary elements, or to print on-demand a full, professional quality catalog.<br />• Courses and programs which are corrected in a single location and then updated in all instances throughout the catalog.<br />• Security using industry standard/best practices for backups, disaster recovery, secure data center, networks, firewall, protocols and encryption.</p>
<p>The planned e-catalog will go live on/before March 15, 2016. <br /> <br /><br />***<br /><br /><a href="/update">Go to Online Update</a><br /></p></div></div>
