<p>The demos will focus on features of the electronic catalogs. The goals of offering an electronic catalog include:</p>
<p>• To provide students with a more accurate and streamlined catalog.<br />• Integration with other technologies such as the academic curriculum process, catalog production and Ellucian’s Collegue.<br />• Consistent, user-friendly navigation, and a search function capable of returning results for specific courses, programs, and other catalog content.<br />• The ability to print any page without unnecessary elements, or to print on-demand a full, professional quality catalog.<br />• Courses and programs which are corrected in a single location and then updated in all instances throughout the catalog.<br />• Security using industry standard/best practices for backups, disaster recovery, secure data center, networks, firewall, protocols and encryption.</p>
<p>The planned e-catalog will go live on/before March 15, 2016. <br /> </p>
