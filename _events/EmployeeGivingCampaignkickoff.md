<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClassDCDCEBD051C34A58ADEAD6490DDEADCA"><p>​The KCC Employee Giving campaign and the KCC United Way campaign have united efforts to create one Employee Giving/United Way combined campaign. <br /><br />Instead of multiple times where employees will be asked to give to these campaigns, there will be one consolidated and collaborative time when donations are requested. <br /><br />The Kick-Off for the united campaign is Wednesday, Sept. 17 from 7-9 a.m. and 3:30-5:30 p.m. in the Iroquois Room, Room D152. All employees are invited to get breakfast any time at the morning session, or light snacks  at the afternoon event.<br /><br />At 8 a.m. Sept. 17, scholarship recipients Kerri Skiles and Molly Ferrell will share how scholarships have benefitted their academic careers. <br /><br />Also, Nick Allen, executive director of United Way of Kankakee County will be present throughout the morning session to discuss this year’s campaign, which is being chaired by Lisa Dugan, and our very own president, Dr. John Avendano.<br /><br />This year the KCC Foundation Employee Giving goal is $20,000, and the United Way goal is $16,000 – for a combined goal of $36,000. There will be a special surprise if this goal is met. Come to the kickoff to see what it is!  <br /><br />The Employee Giving/United Way campaign will continue actively until Friday, Oct. 31. A Halloween Cookout will be held that day for all who contribute toward the campaign.<br /><br />The <a href="/Foundation/giving/eg/Pages/2014campaign.aspx">Employee Giving website</a> has more information.<br /><br /> <br /><br /> <br /> <br />***<br /><a href="/update">Go to online update</a><br /><br /> <br /></p></div></div>
