<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass01A5CF68586B4E1586C3A441001EDEBE"><div><font size="2">An April 27 event at KCC will give prospective students an opportunity to take the express route to enrollment. </font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />At the “Enrollment Express,” Saturday, April 27 from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m., prospective (and current) students will get information about KCC programs, take admissions tests, meet advisers, register and apply for financial aid. Admissions testing will be open from 9 a.m. – 1 p.m.</div>
<div><br />Students should bring a photo ID, their high school transcripts, ACT scores if they have them, and a copy of their most recent tax return to apply for financial aid. Students coming to KCC after attending another college should bring in either official or unofficial college transcripts.</div>
<div> <br /> “The event is organized so that students can accomplish a variety of goals,” said Denise Burklow, coordinator of recruitment services at KCC. “For those who want to leisurely explore what KCC offers, several program coordinators and advisers will be on hand to provide information. But, for busy people who want to tackle all the enrollment pieces in one day, we’re offering computerized testing, course selections and registration.” </div>
<div><br />KCC advisers and financial aid specialists will be available to assist with applications and information. <br />For questions for more information, contact Burklow at 815-802-8508 or </font><a href="mailto:dburklow@kcc.edu"><font size="2">dburklow@kcc.edu</font></a><font size="2">.</font></div>
