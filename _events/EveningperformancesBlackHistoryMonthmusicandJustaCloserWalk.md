<div>Members of <strong>Chapman’s Trio</strong> are from the Pembroke/Hopkins Park area. Each man got his start in music playing in church and the local elementary school band. </div>
<div><br>The group has been playing together for several years at different occasions. </div>
<div><br>“The weird thing was we never get together to formally practice together, but when we would get together, we knew each other’s style so well, until everyone assumed that we spend hours in formal rehearsals,” said group member Ken Crite. “Gospel musicians have been our greatest influence, which is the root of all of the other styles that we play.”</div>
<div><br>Chapman’s Trio plays a variety of music including gospel, R&amp;B, blues and jazz. </div>
<div><br>Robert Chapman received formal training from VanderCook College of Music in Chicago. The other two musicians, Raphael Smyly and Crite graduated from Jarvis Christian College in Texas.</div>
