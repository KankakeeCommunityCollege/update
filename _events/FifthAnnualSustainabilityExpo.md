<div>The fifth annual KCC Sustainability Expo will be from noon - 6 p.m. Wednesday, April 24 in the KCC entryway Atrium and College Center.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Scheduled during the same week as Earth Day, the Sustainability Expo provides an opportunity for individuals, vendors, businesses, industries and service providers involved in “Green Technology” to display their goods and services and interact with the public.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It includes a showcase of products, services and accomplishments in areas of energy efficiency, conservation, and green- house gas emission reduction.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A new feature of the expo this year will be a display of electric and hybrid vehicles displayed by local car dealers. “This will be a great opportunity for those attending the Expo to learn about EV and Hybrid technology from area dealers,” said Rich Schultz, coordinator of sustainability. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>An Energy Wall display with information about best techniques for energy efficient building construction will return to the Expo for the fourth year. There also will be an interactive “Energy Bike” exhibit and an exhibit provided by the Field Museum of Chicago. For the third time, there will be an exhibit of recycled art created by local grade school students. <br /> <br />Please contact Rich at <a href="mailto:rschultz@kcc.edu">rschultz@kcc.edu</a> or phone 815-802-8243 for more information. Other KCC sustainability events are listed at <a href="/sustainability">www.kcc.edu/sustainability</a>. </div>
