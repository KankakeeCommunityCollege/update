<div><font size="2" face="Arial">“With group travels and frank discussions, the students (in Crossing Borders) confront the complex implications of the supposed ‘clash of civilizations’ between Islam and the West,” according to production notes on the film. “The relationships formed through shared experiences contrast sharply with the media-shaped views Americans and Muslims have of each other. Humor, honesty and a willingness to be challenged all bring individuals closer to each other and the relationships that develop disarm hidden stereotypes.”</font></div>
