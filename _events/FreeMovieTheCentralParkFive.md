<div><font size="2">Three films featuring aspects of the American justice system will be shown during a free movie series this spring at Kankakee Community College.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“The movies selected for the film series each pose various questions including rights of prisoners and police officers use of deadly force,” said Steve DePasquale, a KCC history professor. “A brief discussion will follow each film regarding the questions at hand.”</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The first film is Criminal Injustice: Death and Politics at Attica. It is a 2013 documentary about the 1971 riot and prisoner takeover at Attica Prison in New York which resulted in 43 deaths. </font></div>
<div><font size="2"><br /></font></div>
<div><font size="2">“Based on interviews with eyewitnesses who just now are telling their stories, as well as access to newly discovered documents, the film sheds new light on exactly what happened at Attica between September 9-13, 1971,” according to filmmaker Blue Sky Project’s website. It will be shown at 7 p.m. Tuesday, March 4 in KCC’s auditorium. <br /></font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">The second film in the series is The Central Park Five, to be shown at 7 p.m. Tuesday, April 1 in KCC’s auditorium.<br /></font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">In The Central Park Five, award-winning filmmaker Ken Burns tells the story of five black and Latino teenagers from Harlem who were convicted of raping a white woman in New York City’s Central Park in 1989. They were released after serving between six and 13 years in prison following another man’s confession to the crime. DNA evidence supported the confession. <br /></font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">“The film chronicles The Central Park Jogger case, for the first time from the perspective of these five teenagers whose lives were upended by this miscarriage of justice,” according to film’s PBS website.<br /></font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">The final film of the series will be Fruitvale Station, and it will be shown at 7 p.m. Tuesday, May 6 in the KCC Auditorium.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"> <br />Fruitvale Station, which won the Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize in 2013, is based on the true story of Oscar Grant (Michael B. Jordan), a 22-year-old Bay Area resident who decided on Dec. 31, 2008 to get a head start on his resolutions including being better son, boyfriend and father.<br /></div></font>
<div><font size="2"></font></div>
<div><font size="2">“Crossing paths with friends, family and strangers, Oscar starts out well, as the day goes on, he realizes that changes are not going to come easily,” according to the film’s website, fruitvalefilm.com. “His resolve takes a tragic turn, however, when BART (Bay Area Rapid Transit) officers shoot him in cold blood at the Fruitvale subway stop on New Year's Day. Oscar's life and tragic death will shake the entire nation.” <br /></font></div>
