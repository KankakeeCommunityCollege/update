<div>“The Civil war is the bloodiest war the U.S. has ever been a part of,” said Willie Dixon Jr., the play’s writer and director. “More than 600,000 Americans died. The compromise was a way to try and stop this. They realized that war doesn’t solve anything.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>Dixon, who has a master’s degree in history from Roosevelt University in Chicago, also said the faltering democracy of the U.S. would not have survived if the Confederates won the war. So the compromise was more than an effort to keep peace, it was an effort to keep the democracy alive.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>The men, and the actors who will play them, are: Henry Clay, played by Allan Weaver; Thaddeus Stevens, played by Scott Kistler; Stephen Douglas, played by John Babich; and William Seward, played by Bert Jacobson.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>All of the actors are KCC employees. Babich is a professor in the Business/Technology Division, Kistler is a professor in the Humanities and Social Science Division, Weaver is coordinator of GED programs and Jacobson is dean of environmental and institutional sustainability.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>Clay, nicknamed “The Great Compromiser,” was the author of the Compromise of 1850. An Illinois senator, Douglas supported the compromise as a way to lay the groundwork for a run at the presidency. Some elements of the compromise included having California enter the union as a non-slave state, and settlement of the Texas boundary. Stevens and Seward were opponents of the compromise, which strengthened the fugitive slave act and allowed for some territories to become slave states.</div>
