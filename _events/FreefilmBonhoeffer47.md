<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass40D8B3EA965A404EA9BAF7C03575B692"><div>   <font size="2"> The second film in the documentary film series is &quot;Bonhoeffer&quot;, which will be shown at 6 p.m. Thursday, April 7 in KCC's auditorium.</font></div><font size="2">
<div><br />    The film tells the story of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German theologian who offered one of the first clear voices of resistance to Adolf Hitler. According to Full Frame Documentary Film Festival, &quot;The film, shot on location in Germany and the United States, features interviews with family members, friends, students and associates who knew Bonhoeffer personally, including the last interview given by Bonhoeffer's closest friend and biographer, Eberhard Bethge.&quot;</div>
<div><br />    The third film in the series is &quot;Waiting for Superman&quot; It will be shown at 4 p.m. and 7 p.m. Wednesday, April 27 in KCC's auditorium. Directed and co-written by Davis Guggenheim, the 2010 documentary explores the state of public education in the U.S. and how it is affecting our children. </div>
<div><br />    A plot summary from the Sundance Film Festival states: &quot;As he follows a handful of promising kids through a system that inhibits, rather than encourages, academic growth, Guggenheim undertakes an exhaustive review of public education, surveying 'drop-out factories' and 'academic sinkholes,' methodically dissecting the system and its seemingly intractable problems.&quot;</div>
