<p>The documentary film, Little Town of Bethlehem, which focuses on three men of three different faiths working for nonviolent resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, will be shown at 7 p.m. Thursday, Dec. 9 in the auditorium. </p>
<p>The event is free and the public is invited.</p>
<p>EthnoGraphic Media, which produced the film, says &quot;it shares the gripping story of how three men born into the cycle of violence have chosen to risk everything to bring peace to their homelands. Sami and Ahmad are Palestinians, one is a Christian, the other a Muslim; and Yonatan is an Israeli Jew. Independently they find inspiration through the example of Martin Luther King Jr.’s and Mahatma Gandhi’s sacrificial commitment to equality. At great personal cost they have joined together in a heroic and dangerous cause.&quot;</p>
<p>Little Town of Bethlehem will be the first offering in the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences film series.</p>
