<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass37EFD391E31B4E119905D04C7BE442C5"><p>​This Sustainability Week event, &quot;From the Animals’ Point of View&quot; will be presented by KCC Adjunct Professor Dawn Wrobel from 2-3 p.m. Tuesday, April 21 in the Iroquois Room (Room D152).</p>
<p><strong>Event description:</strong> Did you ever think about sustainability from the viewpoint of the animals? The presenter, Dawn Wrobel, is a KCC adjunct geography professor who also works as an animal communicator or interspecies interpreter. In addition to working with companion animals, she has served as a consultant for two zoos. Over the last 10 years she has asked the animals about what they want humans to know about sharing the planet and their ideas for human behavior change. Join Wrobel for a look at sustainability from the animals’ point of view. We’ll also talk about the differences in how cultures view animals, including those that now accord animals the same rights as humans, and talk about some common animal behavior issues. Included will be an exercise to help you see humans and the world from an animal’s point of view and time for questions and answers.</p>
<p>This is one of a number of FREE Sustainability Week events being offered at KCC from April 20 to 24. <br /><br /><br />***<br /><a href="/update">Go to Online Update</a></p></div></div>
