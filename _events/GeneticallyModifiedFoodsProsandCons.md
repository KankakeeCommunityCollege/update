<p><strong>Event description:</strong> Much of the food we eat today has been genetically modified or altered in some way. This will be a one-hour discussion sponsored by the Miner Memorial Library and led by Karen Becker. Although no advance preparation is required, students are strongly encouraged to read a couple of articles on the topic, or watch some video clips, as this will make everyone better prepared for a discussion. The following link has a resource guide with suggested articles, websites and video clips:   <a href="http://kcc.libguides.com/gmosproscons">http://kcc.libguides.com/gmosproscons</a>.</p>
