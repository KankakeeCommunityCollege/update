<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass2EE2A0FAE4E842CFAE7763B88347A7A9"><p>​This Sustainability Week event, &quot;Greening Your Skin Care and The Story of Cosmetics&quot; will be presented by KCC Adjunct Professor Dawn Wrobel from 4-5 p.m. Tuesday, April 21 in the Iroquois Room (Room D152).</p>
<p><strong>Event description:</strong> According to the medical press, our skin comes in contact with as many as 515 toxic compounds every day. Where you live determines some of those toxins, but most are things we use voluntarily. In this program we’ll view another of the “The Story of” programs and follow it up with recipes for creating safe skin care and household cleaning products using things already in your kitchen or bathroom. Did you know:</p>
<ul><li>You can recycle your coffee grounds to make a safe skin scrub.</li>
<li>You can use vanilla extract to make an insect repellant.</li>
<li>A grape can help you achieve soft, glowing skin.</li></ul>
<p>Learn how to start detoxing your skin care routine!</p>
<p>This is one of a number of FREE Sustainability Week events being offered at KCC from April 20 to 24. <br /><br />***<br /><a href="/update">Go to Online Update</a></p>
