<div></div>
<div><a href="/Documents/Hedy-Habra-visit-flier-with-quote.pdf">View a flier about the event here.</a></div>
<div><br />Habra will read from and discuss two of her works—<em>Tea in Heliopolis </em>(2013), a collection of poetry, and <em>Flying Carpets </em>(2012), a short story collection. The public is invited.</div>
<div><br />The free event will be from 9:30-10:45 a.m. Thursday, Oct. 24 in the KCC Workforce Development Center Conference Hall, Room D140. Habra also will sign copies of her books from 12:30-1:15 p.m. in the KCC College Center.<br /></div>
<div></div>
<div>“Professor Habra stimulates our imagination as she weaves the spice of the Middle East into her narratives and poetry and interprets the exotic mysteries of her life for our pleasure,” said Penelope Stickney, a KCC writing professor. </div>
<div></div>
<div>“Her path of inquiry and insight enables us to understand human similarities and appreciate cultural differences.”<br /></div>
<div></div>
<div>Both books have received praise from fellow authors.<br /></div>
<div>“<em>Tea in Heliopolis</em> is an irresistible book, offering poems of exquisite charm and sensibility,” said Pablo Medina, author of <em>Cubop City Blues</em>. “Both cinematic and painterly, moving across vast swaths of ancient geography. Habra’s work ... takes you on a voyage richly textured with Old World mystery and New World urgency.”<br /></div>
<div></div>
<div>Another author, Naomi Shihab Nye, said “Hedy Habra's hospitable poems, lush with intricate landscapes of relating and remembering, are so rich they make me homesick. Here are worlds, both ancient and modern, spun and sung in shining wonder.”<br /></div>
<div><em></em></div>
<div><em>Flying Carpets</em> is 2013 Winner of the Arab American Book Award’s Honorable Mention in Fiction. “This is a book full of marvels, beautifully written,” said Khaled Mattawa, author of <em>Amorisco</em>.<br /></div>
<div></div>
<div>Habra was born in Egypt and is of Lebanese descent. She also has published a book of literary criticism, <em>Mundos alternos y artísticos en Vargas Llosa </em>(2012). She has two master’s degrees in English and both a master’s and doctorate in Spanish literature, all from Western Michigan University. Habra is a Spanish instructor at Western Michigan University. </div>
