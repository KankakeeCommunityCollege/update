<p><font size="2">“The Hispanic community itself is a perfect example of the mixtures of African, Indigenous and European influences,” said Deisy Anderson, Ph.D., KCC multicultural student services coordinator. “This year we will be inspired by the indigenous contributions of song and dance from Mexico and Ecuador. In addition, our aim is also to promote education, health and wellness through these creative avenues.”</font></p></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">The first scheduled event is at 8:30 a.m., when Alejando Quezada will perform Aztec dances inspired by dances he learned as a boy in Mexico City. The dances express how Native Americans worshipped nature.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Then, from 9-10 a.m., Lisa Weaver, a Zumba instructor at Kankakee Community College, will be leading a Zumba class. Zumba is a way to get in shape by moving to contemporary and popular sounds of Latin America.</font></div>

<p><font size="2">Beginning at 10 a.m., the owner of Isidro’s Tamales y Taquería, Francisco Isidro Martinez, will give a demonstration of how to cook authentic Mexican food. A food tasting will follow the demonstration.</font></p></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">The performer at 11 a.m. is frequently in-demand, Anderson said.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">“We have a very special guest this year,” she said. “We are very fortunate to have an indigenous flautist, Anibal Lopez, coming from Chicago. Native to Ecuador, he has been playing the indigenous flute professionally for 35 years. He makes his own instruments and enjoys the traditional indigenous rhythms of Sanjuanitos and celebrating the Fiesta del Sol or Summer Solstice festivals with the rhythms of Intiraymi.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">During Hispanic Arts and Heritage Day, money will be raised for scholarships for KCC students. Fundraisers will include split-the-pot and donations. Each year, need-based scholarships are awarded to KCC students using funds raised during Hispanic Arts and Heritage Day and other events.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">The Kankakee Farmers’ Market is at the corner of Merchant Street and Schuyler Avenue. It is held on Saturdays from late April through October.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">The Hispanic Arts &amp; Heritage Day for Education is sponsored by the KCC Hispanic/Latino Community Advisory Committee; the Kankakee County Hispanic Partnership, Inc.; and the Kankakee Farmer's Market. The Farmer’s Market is held at the corner of Schuyler Avenue and Merchant Street in Kankakee.</font></div>
