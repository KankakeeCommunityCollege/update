<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class=ExternalClassB77C510C732F472DBE94BCB7A5C9EDAC><div>In celebration of Hispanic Heritage Month, The Reventones will be performing in Kankakee Community College’s College Center on Monday, Oct. 1 from noon - 1 p.m.</div>
<div>The Spanish guitar duo plays traditional and modern Flamenco and Spanish music. “The magic of The Reventones is the chemistry of these two artists and their common ground rooted in Rumba, South American, Cuban, Pop, and Classical music,” said Lindsey Fritz, coordinator of student life and development at KCC. “Their unique sound emanates the perfect combination of sweet and spicy.” </div>
<div>This event is free and open to the community.  </div>
