<div><br />An analysis including implications of economic growth in India will be the focus of a lecture at KCC on Friday, April 19.</div>
<div> </div>

<div> </div>
<div>“Over the last two decades or so, India has seen an unprecedented growth in the ranks of its middle-class,” Roy said. “Wage rates have risen as demand for labor has increased, in large part attributable to outsourcing of jobs from developed countries.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“We will look at some of the success stories of development, while drawing attention to the plight of those whom development has passed by.” </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the world, India is the seventh largest in land area, but the second highest in population.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Roy is a professor of mathematics and economics at KCC, where she has taught for 10 years. She has a doctorate from the Indira Gandhi Institute of Developmental Research, a master’s degree from the University of Calcutta, and an M.B.A. from Governors State University. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The presentation is sponsored by the KCC Cultural Diversity Committee as part of its Spring 2013 Inter-Cultural Lecture Series.<br /> <br /></div>
