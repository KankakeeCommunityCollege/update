<p>On <a href="http://www.agday.org/">National Agriculture Day</a>, Wednesday, March 18,the Agri-Hort Technology program and Horticulture Club will offer an interactive Ag Facts Trivia Wheel from 10 a.m. - 2 p.m. in the College Center.</p>
<p>Farm machinery also will be on display outside.</p>
<p>According to the Agriculture Council of America website:</p>
<p>&quot;American farmers are working harder than ever, and it shows. Today, each American farmer feeds more than 144 people. And the need for food produced in the United States is dramatic. Agriculture is this nation's #1 export and vitally important in sustaining a healthy economy.</p>
<p>&quot;And it's not just the farmer who makes our food possible. The entire agriculture industry, all the way to the grocery store, are vital links in a chain that brings food to every citizen - and millions of people abroad.</p>
<p>Frankly, it's easy to take agriculture for granted in America. Our food is readily accessible and safe. For this, we're unbelievably fortunate ... but that doesn't mean we don't have an obligation to recognize how it's made possible.&quot;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.agday.org/">National Ag Day</a> (March 18), organized by the Agriculture Council of America. It is a good time to reflect on, and be grateful for, American agriculture!</p>
