<div> </div>
<div>The public is invited.</div>
<div><br />Topics will include how different cultures educate their students, strategies and methods different education systems can learn from each other, and the similarities and differences in how technology is used to learn in different systems. There will be time for questions and discussion.</div>
<div><br />KCC’s guests for the presentation will be Jan Sander Heutink from The Netherlands and Panu Kosonen from Finland. Their visit to KCC is part of a two-week exchange program offered through the Illinois Consortium for International Studies and Programs.</div>
<div><br />“I'm very interested in the organization of education in such a huge country as the U.S., especially to people who are more practically oriented and less theoretically educated,” Heutink said. “I only know America via the media and by the reports given by colleagues who have done a trip like this before.”</div>
<div><br />Heutink teaches engineering and construction management classes at Deltion College in Zwolle, The Netherlands. Heutink said it is one of the largest colleges in the country. His students are between the ages of 16 and 22 and they are taught by a team of 12 teachers who work with about 50 students per year. Training lasts four years including multiple traineeships, which are similar to internships.<br /> Kosonen is a teacher at North Karelia College Kitee, in Kitee, Finland. He teaches electricity and automation. Prior to becoming a teacher, he was a maintenance engineer in the forest industry.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>“The most important thing I am interested in … is internationalization,” Kosonen said. “I am interested in U.S.A. educational systems and want to get to know different teaching methods.”</div>
<div><br />The exchange “in a small way, has to do with discovering how small a world we really have,” said Charlie Cooke, a professor in KCC’s Business/Technology Division. “Through that discovery we help each other and convey a message that we are not all that different from one another.”</div>
<div><br />In May 2014, Cooke will visit Finland and Kosonen’s school. Heutink’s exchange partner is John Bordeau, also a professor in KCC’s Business/Technology Division. He will visit The Netherlands in May 2014.</div>
