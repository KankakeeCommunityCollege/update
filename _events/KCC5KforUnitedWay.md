<div>KCC will host its fifth annual 5K for United Way on Wednesday, Oct. 9, along the banks of the Kankakee River. </div>
<div><br />“United Way supports more than 45 local agencies, and we sponsor this 5K run and 2-mile walk as a way to further help those who rely on those services,” said David Cagle, KCC’s 5K event coordinator. “I would love to see 200 participants this year. There’s camaraderie, a beautiful route and plenty of refreshments. Come on out and support KCC and the United Way of Kankakee County!”</div>
<div><br />The 5K and the 2-mile walk will start and finish on KCC’s campus, with separate routes for runners and walkers. Check-in begins at 3 p.m. at the pavilion on the northeast side of KCC’s Riverfront Campus. Race instructions will be given at 4:25 p.m. The run/jog/walk begins at 4:30 p.m.</div>
<div><br />A special KCC employee rate is available: $15 until Sept. 25, and $20 after Sept. 25. For others, the minimum donation is $20 if pre-registered by Sept. 25 and $25 thereafter. For students from grade school through college, the entry is a minimum $10 donation if registered by Sept. 25; and $15 after Sept. 25.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="/Community/Documents/UnitedWay5k_2013flyer_pledgesheet.pdf">A printable registration and pledge form is available here.</a> Registration forms also are available at the first floor reception desk on the Riverfront Campus.</div>
<div><br />All participants receive a commemorative long-sleeve, dri-fit T-shirt. Door prizes, prizes for pledges and more will be offered. Post-race refreshments are sponsored by CommonWealth Credit Union.  <br /></div>
<div> </div>
<div>All donations go to support United Way of Kankakee County, serving Kankakee County and parts of Iroquois County. The United Way supports 45 local programs and 24 member agencies. Last year, more than 65,000 local people were served by these programs.</div>
