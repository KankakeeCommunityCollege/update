<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE809C416891544A285FF86EC4FB77F88"><p>​The KCC men’s basketball team will meet a local rival in a historic gym on Monday, Nov. 24.</p>
<p>The game will be a homecoming of sorts for the Cavaliers, who played in the same gym from 1979 to 1988. The game site, at 150 N. Indiana Ave. in downtown Kankakee, is a former National Guard Armory which was built in 1921. It has been remodeled and is operated by the Kankakee Valley Park District as the <a href="http://www.kvpd.com/pages/reccenter.html">KVPD RecCenter</a>.</p>
<p>“They had some great games there and I understand that the Kankakee park district has totally remodeled the gym,” said Ted Petersen, KCC’s athletic director. </p>
<p>Game time is 7 p.m., with KCC taking on the cross-town rival Olivet Nazarene University JV team. General admission is $3. KCC students can attend for free when they show a KCC student ID. </p>
<p>The Cavs will also honor their former coach, Denny Lehnus, who is retiring from coaching after 50 years. Lehnus coached for KCC from 1974 to 1993. He led the Cavs to 548 victories, including second place finishes in the national tournament in 1985 and 1988. Lehnus was inducted into the NJCAA Men’s Basketball Hall of Fame in 1992.<br /></p>
