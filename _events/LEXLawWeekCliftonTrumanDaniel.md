<div>“This year the theme of National Law Day is ‘Realizing the Dream – Equality for All’ to commemorate the 150 year anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation and the 50 year anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s ‘I Have a Dream’ speech,” said Kris Condon, KCC faculty member and Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program coordinator. “Daniel will weave that theme into his remarks and he also has interesting stories about his famous grandparents.”</div>
<div><br />Daniel is the oldest grandson of President Harry S. Truman. He is honorary chairman of the board of the Harry S. Truman Library Institute. A frequent speaker and fundraiser, he is author of the 1995 book, Growing Up With My Grandfather: Memories of Harry S. Truman and Dear Harry, Love Bess: Bess Truman’s Letters to Harry Truman, 1919-1843.</div>
