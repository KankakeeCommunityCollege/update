<div><br />“African countries have for a long time been viewed as lost cases for economic and social development and political stability,” said Prosper Hevi, the presenter. “This view has persisted due, in a large proportion, to the overwhelming negative propaganda and very strong stereotypical perspectives and agendas of certain interest groups both within and beyond the boundaries of the continent. </div>
<div><br />“The presentation will attempt to highlight some more positive cultural, economic, education, technology and political advancements exemplified by the pioneering West African country of Ghana. I will attempt an informative and balanced perspective of the life, culture, economic, and political conditions and the experience of the Ghanaian people.”</div>
<div><br />Hevi is a professor in KCC’s Business/Technology Division, where he has taught for 14 years. He is a native of Ghana who has lived in the U.S. and Canada during the last 30 years. Hevi has a bachelor’s degree from the University of Ghana, a master’s degree from George Washington University and a master’s degree from the University of Windsor.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The presentation is sponsored by the KCC Cultural Diversity Committee as part of its Spring 2013 Inter-Cultural Lecture Series.</div>
