<p><font size="2">“‘Macbeth’ is Shakespeare’s shortest and most relentless play,” said Casey Kaleba, the director. “The story races through three kings struggling for control of a country torn by civil war and cursed by spiritual unrest: foreign powers employ mercenary armies, political careers are secured through bloodshed, strange and supernatural deeds haunt the sleepless characters.”</font></p></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">This production will have “Macbeth” in the present day.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“A psychological study, ‘Macbeth’ seeks to answer the question of whether individuals follow a path of predestination or have the privilege of free will,” explains KCC Introduction to Shakespeare Professor Penelope Stickney. “Political ambition and power are addressed through magic, violence, passion, and madness—a supernatural adventure story.”</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">The second play will be “The Odyssey,” at 6:30 p.m. in the KCC Auditorium.</font></div>
<div><br />

<p><font size="2">“Homer's words are an inexhaustible resource for theatrical exploration,” said Jason King Jones, who serves as both writer and director of this adaptation. “My inspiration for this version came from ‘The Odyssey’ Books 9-12: the chapters spoken by Odysseus to King Alcinous and his Phaeacians. The inspiration easily lent itself to having two actors play Odysseus—one telling the story, one enacting the events. Indeed, through Odysseus' unbelievable journey we see the cost of prideful self-confidence and the burden of leadership, but we also witness the triumph of determination.”</font></p></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“‘The Odyssey’ recounts one of the oldest stories in literature and explores the power of family, relationships and desire,” Stickney said. “Odysseus’ desire to live and love empowers his epic journey across dark seas to strange lands while battling face-to-face with gods and monsters.”</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">Both plays feature performers from National Players, based in Maryland. The 10-member cast for each play is a group of diverse young professional actors. National Players was founded in 1949 and is America's longest-running touring company.</font></div>
