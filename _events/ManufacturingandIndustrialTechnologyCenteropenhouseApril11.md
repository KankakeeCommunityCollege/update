<p><font size="2">“The Manufacturing and Industrial Technology Center is an excellent example of how KCC turns community needs into educational opportunities,” said Dr. John Avendano, KCC president. “Several of our local manufacturers had vacancies for welders, millwrights and fabricators and they turned to the college to help fill the positions. The KCC degree and certificate programs offered at the MITC are perfect fits. As a community college, our mission is to be proactive to employer needs, and to educate and prepare our community members for good-paying jobs like these.”</font></p></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“When employers approached us, the enrollment in welding and machine tool classes were already at capacity,” said Dennis Sorensen, vice president for instructional and student success at KCC.</font></div>

<p><font size="2">“We wanted to move quickly to expand. It was fortunate that we found a nearby location with enough space to locate the programs. With the new MITC, KCC can educate nearly twice as many welding students. We also added a new Manufacturing Technology program to our line up, and expanded course offerings to include fabrication and transportation, warehousing and logistics.”</font></p></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">KCC program administrators worked with area employers to identify degrees and certificates that lead to career opportunities.</font></div>
<div><br /><font size="2">“We knew that students want to learn skills quickly and move into a good-paying job,” said Paul Carlson, associate dean of the Business/Technology Division at KCC.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">“That’s why we developed a series of certificates that can build on each other and lead to an associate degree. Students can complete certificates, move into the workplace and continue to take additional courses around their work schedules.”</font></div>
