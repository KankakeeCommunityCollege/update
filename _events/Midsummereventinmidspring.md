<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class=ExternalClass8D02C713930C4A46B60AED72943B7028><div><font size=2>The juiciest plots aren't always on reality television. </font></div>
<div><font size=2>    <br>In William Shakespeare's &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream,&quot; Gods mix with mortals, a feuding king and queen unleash magical practical jokes on each other, spells yield improbable love affairs, and a band of comical tradesmen wander into an enchanted wood and are transformed in the most unlikely of ways.  </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>A free 90-minute performance of &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; will be Tuesday, April 26 at 12:30 p.m. in the auditorium. The public is invited.</div>
<div><br>&quot;'A Midsummer Night's Dream,' Shakespeare's most popular comedy, has delighted audiences for over 400 years with its celebration of love,&quot; said Writing Professor Penelope Stickney. &quot;This performance will highlight some of the funniest moments of that play with its frolicking fairies, star-crossed lovers, and bumbling tradesmen.&quot; </div>
<div><br>Stickney noted that &quot;A Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; is a topic in the KCC Introduction to Humanities class, and studied more in-depth in the Introduction to Shakespeare course.</div>
<div><br>Actors for the play will be the National Players from Olney, Md. The production offers a fresh twist on the setting, making it relevant to today's audiences. For example, the woods glow in the dark and fairies dance to electronica, setting the scene for the wonderful and silly vagaries of love.  </div>
<div><br>The cast and their roles are Kyle Blair, Bottom/Egeus; Hannah Burkauser, Hermia/Snug; Jenny Donovan, Helena/Snarveling; Chris Egging Oberon/Theseus; Greg Magee, Lysander/Quince; Kelsey Meiklejohn, Puck/Philostrate; Sam Robinovitz, Demetrius/Flute; and Bethany Rowe, Titania/Hippolyta.</div>
<div><br>Now in its 62nd year of touring, the National Players are America's longest running classical touring company. The National Players have performed for more than 2.5 million audience members in 40 states, plus the East Wing of the White House, in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East for American military. </div>
<div><br>The performance is sponsored by KCC's Humanities and Social Sciences Division.  <br> </font></div></div></div>
