<div>
<div>The movie, <em>Bully</em> will be shown at 11 a.m., 3 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. Thursday, March 21 in the KCC Auditorium.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In its review, <em>Time Magazine</em> said Bully is &quot;a documentary as vivid as any horror film, as heartbreaking as any Oscar-worthy drama.&quot; The movie's director is Lee Hirsch. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>According to the Bully website: BULLY is a beautifully cinematic, character-driven documentary. At its heart are those with huge stakes in this issue whose stories each represent a different facet of America’s bullying crisis. Filmed over the course of the 2009/2010 school year, BULLY opens a window onto the pained and often endangered lives of bullied kids, revealing a problem that transcends geographic, racial, ethnic and economic borders. It documents the responses of teachers and administrators to aggressive behaviors that defy “kids will be kids” clichés, and it captures a growing movement among parents and youths to change how bullying is handled in schools, in communities and in society as a whole.</div>

<div>The Motion Picture Association of American rated the version being shown at KCC as PG-13: &quot;Some material may be inappropriate for children under 13. Intense thematic material, disturbing content, and some strong language, all involving kids.&quot;</div>
<div><br />The presentation is sponsored by KCC's chapter of Phi Theta Kappa International Honor Society and the KCC Gay Straight Alliance club.</div>
