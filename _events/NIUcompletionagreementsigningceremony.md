<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClassD5CE6F04D4C84675AA7583B2912E976A"><p>​Faculty and staff are invited to a signing ceremony with Northern Illinois University on Friday, Oct. 23 at 1:30 p.m. in the Arts and Sciences Foyer.</p>
<p>The agreement forms a new degree completion program that allows some KCC students to earn a Bachelor of Science in technology degree from NIU without leaving the region.</p>
<p>The event also commemorates a reverse transfer agreement put in place last August which allows NIU students who attended KCC to apply credits from the university toward completion of a KCC associate degree.</p>
<p>Refreshments will be served.</p></div></div>
