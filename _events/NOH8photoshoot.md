<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass94F996DDFD0D418E963D513529419C9F"><p>â€‹The NOH8 Campaign (NOH8 meaning &quot;No Hate&quot;) is a charitable organization in the United States whose mission is to promote marriage, gender and human equality through education, advocacy, social media, and visual protest. It formed in response to Proposition 8 in California, which banned same-sex marriage in 2008. <br /><br />Photos feature subjects with duct tape over their mouths, symbolizing their voices being silenced by Prop 8 and similar legislation around the world, with &quot;NOH8&quot; painted on one cheek in protest. <br /><br />Come get your picture taken in the College Center and show your support.</p>
