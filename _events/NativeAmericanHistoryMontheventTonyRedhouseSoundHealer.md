Through the traditions of his heritage, Redhouse said he aspires to motivate and inspire youth, families and the general public as they celebrate Native American Heritage Month.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"><br />For traditional Native American people, the drum is the central force that keeps the songs, dances and ceremonies alive in the hearts of the people, Redhouse said. “It unites the feet of our people in dance, and inspires us to sing our personal songs from within,” he said.</font></div>
