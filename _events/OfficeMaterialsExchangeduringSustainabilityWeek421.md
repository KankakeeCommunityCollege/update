<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class=ExternalClassA0459950EEBF43A5B16D0CC8F10B8ED2><div><font size=2>From: Rich Schultz, coordinator of the Sustainability Center, Sustainability and Planning<br> <br>    As part of this year's Sustainability Week activities, we have scheduled an &quot;Office Materials Exchange&quot; for Thursday, April 21 from 10:30 a.m. - 2:30 p.m. in Room L 279. </font></div><font size=2>
<div><br>    &quot;I really like this idea,&quot; said Dr. John Avendano, KCC president. &quot;It will be a nice, inexpensive way to reuse our office supplies and materials and exhibit being 'Green.'&quot;</div>
<div><br>    I received a positive response from several staff members to my earlier suggestion regarding this event, so we're going to go for it. The goal is to avoid ordering new office supplies in one area or department of KCC when another is recycling or worse -- throwing away -- the same supplies! </div>
<div><br>    Remember - Reduce, Reuse, Recycle!</div>
<div><br>    Anyone who has unused, gently used or excess office supplies is encouraged to bring them to Room L279 before 10:30 a.m. on April 21. Beginning at 10:30 a.m. April 21, all staff and faculty are encouraged to visit Room L279 to look over the collection and take whatever they can use. The idea is a sort of office supplies &quot;garage sale.&quot; It's that simple! </div>
<div><br>    There are some stipulations. The items are to be used here for KCC business and whoever takes the items must plan to actually use them. </div>
<div><br>    This idea has been tried with great success at other schools. McHenry County College has done it for the last five years and the staff there look forward to it. </div>
<div><br>    It saves resources, it saves money, and it's a more sustainable way of doing things. </div>
