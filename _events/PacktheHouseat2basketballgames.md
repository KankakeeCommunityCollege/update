<div><br>“I am tremendously excited for both our men's and women's basketball programs!” said Ted Petersen, KCC athletic director. “It has brought a lot of positive attention to both teams and to Kankakee Community College. It also brings a lot of attention from our opponents. We always know that our opponents will bring their best effort, which will then hopefully allow our teams to get better.”</div>
