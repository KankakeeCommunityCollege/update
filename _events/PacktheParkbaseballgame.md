<div><br>“The KCC Cavaliers baseball team has won 22 of its last 25 games,” said Kari Sargeant, KCC director of marketing and public relations, citing the team’s record as of April 9. “The college is hosting fan days for all its sports this year so students and the community can share the excitement of watching teams which regularly excel on a national level. Baseball, along with other KCC’s sports teams often make deep runs in the regional and national tournaments.”<br></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since 1969, 19 KCC baseball players have played professional ball, and 12 have been drafted by major league teams. Eleven former Cavaliers are currently on the rosters of four-year colleges in Illinois, Indiana and Kentucky.</div>
