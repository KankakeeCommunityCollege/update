Ryan Gymnasium at KCC. Admission is free and there will also be FREE hot dogs, chips and lemonade for the first 100 fans at each game.<br /> <br />Cheerleaders from Clifton Central High School will perform during the women’s game, and the Menagerie Quartet will perform during the men’s game. A DJ will also provide music for fans throughout the evening.<br /> <br />“We want the community to feel school spirit on game days for Cavaliers sports, and the campus should be alive with excitement and enthusiasm,” said Laura Gardner, coordinator of student life. “To spread a sense of pride and competition, Scarlet Fever T-shirts will be available for purchase for $5 during the game.”</font></div>

<div><font size="2">To show support for Cavaliers basketball Nov. 26, employees are invited to wear a Scarlet Fever T-shirt to work, with jeans or other slacks. Staff are asked to use their good judgment in choosing appropriate jeans. Inappropriate jeans include those with patches, fraying, excessive length, low-rise cut and/or very faded. Please use good judgment in choosing whether to wear jeans and/or a Scarlet Fever T-shirt. Depending on what is scheduled for a particular day, they may or may not be appropriate. Professional appearance is important, and all employees share the responsibility of representing the college.</font></div>
