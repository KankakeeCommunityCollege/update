<div>The public is invited to attend. The open house will be from 6:30-8 p.m. in the KCC Iroquois Room, Room D152.

<div> </div>
<div>“Several practicing attorneys and sitting judges serve on the program advisory board and teach courses,” said the program’s coordinator, Dr. Kris Condon. “The KCC Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program focuses on practical knowledge and because case studies, research, writing, and other essential skills are emphasized, students in the program are well prepared for employment.”  <br />            <br />KCC’s Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies program is approved by the American Bar Association. Two degrees are offered through KCC’s program, a two-year associate degree program for those who plan to immediately enter the workforce or to transfer into a four-year bachelor’s degree program and an advanced certificate for those already holding a bachelor’s degree. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The college has established partnership agreements for paralegal graduates with Calumet College of St. Joseph in Indiana, Governors State University in University Park, Illinois State University in Normal, Southern Illinois University at Carbondale, and St. Mary-of-the-Woods in Indiana.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The 36 credit-hour advanced certificate program is designed for those who hold a bachelor’s degree to complete training in appropriate areas such as writing and relevant computer applications to enhance their college coursework.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Both programs in Paralegal/Legal Assistant Studies include intensive training in writing and current technology, as well as a required internship at a law firm or other legal organization. </div>
