<p>Formed in 2003, the Native Pride Dancers educate and entertain audiences of all ages throughout the world with the beauty, skill and majesty of American Indian music and dance. They have been featured at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade. The mission of the dancers is to educate, inspire, motivate and empower diverse communities to bridge the cultural gaps through Indigenous traditions. Performing in traditional native costumes they use song, dance, and audience participation to educate their audiences. Each performance also includes a question and answer time, along with photo opportunities.<br /><br />For more information, phone Laura Gardner, KCC’s coordinator of student life, at 815-802-8628 or email lgardner@kcc.edu.<br /><br /><img alt="Native_Pride_Dancers_update.png" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/Native_Pride_Dancers_update.png" style="margin:5px" /><br /><br /></p>
