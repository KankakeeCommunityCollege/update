<div>“Author and poet Janet Heller encourages others to rise above societal oppressions and individual angst to make the most of the situations and events which often control our lives,” said Penelope Stickney, a KCC professor who teaches writing and poetry courses. “From ‘a lifetime of paying attention’ Heller draws from her experiences of emotional abuse to encourage us toward positive interaction and self-esteem. ‘Have confidence and believe in yourself,’ is her message.”</div>
<div><br />Heller has a doctorate in English language and literature from the University of Chicago. She lives in Portage, Mich.</div>
