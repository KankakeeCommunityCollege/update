Piatt, Ed.D., MBA, the Northeast Senior Account Manager for the Department of Commerce &amp; Economic Opportunity. Piatt's presentation will be &quot;Emotional Intelligence – a Primer for Success in Relationships.&quot; <br> <br>Emotional intelligence is defined as your ability to recognize and understand emotions in yourself and others, and your ability to use this awareness to manage your behavior and relationships. Studies have shown that emotional intelligence can have a profound effect on a person’s ability to create more rewarding, collaborative and satisfying workplace relationships. This, in turn, leads to greater productivity, reduced stress and anxiety, higher levels of performance, and a greater sense of teamwork and camaraderie.  <br> <br>He will offer two sessions, one from 9-11 a.m., and another from 1-3 p.m., in the Iroquois Room.  <br> <br>Immediately following each presentation, there will be a one hour administrative update by Dr. Avendano and members of his cabinet.</font></div>
