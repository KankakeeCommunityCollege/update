<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE148AB57D3754B769B85FABA9BB0DBA9"><p>​A public reception to honor Betty Meents for 39 years of service to the KCC board of trustees will be Thursday, April 23 from 3-5 p.m. in the Arts and Sciences Gallery area at KCC.</p>
<p>The community is invited.</p>
<p>Meents, a Watseka resident, was a member of KCC’s board of trustees from April 1976 until January 2015. She served on the board of trustees longer than anyone else in the college’s history.</p>
<p>“I have enjoyed working with the board of trustees and the great minds of four presidents (Dr. L.H. Horton, Dr. Larry Huffman, Dr. Jerry Weber and Dr. John Avendano). Our KCC faculty and staff are superb as well. My 39 years have been very satisfying.”</p>
<p>Cathy Boicken of Bourbonnais has been appointed to finish Meents’ term on the board.<br /></p>
