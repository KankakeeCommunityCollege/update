<p>Shakespeare’s most enduring tale, “Romeo and Juliet,” will be re-imagined and re-invigorated in a performance at 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, April 23 in the Kankakee Community College auditorium.</font></p></div><font size="2">
<div><br />The play will be approximately two hours long, and includes a post-show discussion. The performance is free and open to the public.</div>
<div><br />“Each year the Players bring an outstanding performance to KCC,” said KCC Professor Penelope Stickney. “This year’s play is set to a techno score with fluorescent lights, smart phones, and texting.  Penned over 400 years ago, the story remains both relevant and modern.”</div>
<div><br />This play is where the line “a rose by any other name” originated, Stickney added. “It represents the emotional and heartfelt cry of a young woman drawn to a man she knows she cannot have, but someone she still wants to love,” she explained.</div>
<div><br />Performers will be from National Players, based in Maryland. The eight-member cast for “Romeo and Juliet” are a group of diverse young professional actors. National Players was founded in 1949 and is America's longest-running touring company.</div>
