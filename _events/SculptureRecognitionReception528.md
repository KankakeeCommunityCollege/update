<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClassE8D7A147A56448E29A3443ED7FE7EC4A"><p>​Three large-scale sculptures have been installed at Kankakee Community College within the last year. <br /><br />The artists—Andrew Arvanetes, Ed McCullough and Barry Tinsley—will be introduced and honored at a reception on Thursday, May 28 from 5-6:30 p.m. at the college’s Riverfront Campus Atrium area and North Patio. The event is hosted by the KCC Foundation. <br /><br /><img width="265" height="212" alt="Tin Man by Arvanetes" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/cropped%20tin%20man-sm.jpg" style="height:247px;float:left;margin:5px;width:308px" />“Tin Man,” created by Arvanetes, greets visitors near the river on the north lawn at KCC. “I grew up in Kankakee with Helgeson Park and the Kankakee River practically in my back yard and many trips to the state park and on the river canoeing.” Arvanetes said on Sept. 29, shortly after the installation was complete “So, the river was very important when I found out that I could get within eye shot of the water. That was really important to me. Since it’s a walking figure, to be so close to the paths, that was important, too.” Arvanetes has an associate degree from KCC, and bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Northern Illinois University in DeKalb. He lives in DeKalb and his work is mostly outdoor sculptures, gallery-size work, and low-relief wall constructions. He has exhibited throughout the United States, as well as in public art projects. Arvenetes has produced sculptures professionally since 1985.  <br /><br /><img alt="Songs of Celan by McCullough" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/song%202-sm.jpg" style="float:left;margin:5px" />“Songs of Celan,” created by McCullough, includes four-pieces created in memory of renowned poet Paul Celan. “I discovered the poetry of Paul Celan in 1989, in a book of his work titled Last Poems, written late in his life,” McCullough said. “Their impact on me was immediate, palpable, and life changing.” The stainless steel series is displayed in the Atrium area on KCC’s Riverfront campus. It was installed April 29. McCullough served in the U.S. Navy and has bachelor’s and master’s degrees from Illinois State University. He has taught at Columbia College Chicago and KCC, and operates a professional studio at his home in Cissna Park. “I’ve taught at many places, I love to teach,” said McCullough. “Seeing students awaken to an idea, and then bring it into reality simply stops the clock with joy.” <br /><br /><img width="299" height="400" alt="Chicago Nike by Tinsley" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/nike%20good%20one-sm.jpg" style="height:331px;float:left;margin:5px;width:248px" />“Chicago Nike,” created by Tinsley, sits on the north lawn of KCC’s Riverfront Campus. It was created in 1998 for the Pier Walk exhibition at Navy Pier, and is fabricated from 2 inch plate steel and granite. At KCC, it was installed on July 14 and 15 last year. The steel was purchased from Belson Steel in Bourbonnais and the granite is from Cold Spring Granite Company in Cold Spring, Minn. The title “Chicago Nike” refers to the strong gestural movement of the sculpture reflecting the dynamic and vitality of the city and the historically famous Greek sculpture, “Nike of Samothrace,” Tinsley said. He has a bachelor’s degree from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, and two master’s degrees from the University of Iowa in Iowa City. He has participated in more than 60 one-man and group exhibitions and has placed over 35 commissioned sculptures in public spaces in the United States, Middle East, and Europe. <br /><br />For more information about the reception, contact Imani Cobb in the Foundation office at 815-802-8252.  <br /><br /></p></div>
