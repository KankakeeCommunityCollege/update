<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass1B39050D8C0C40F782FE5964ECF361DF">
<div>On Monday, June 3, KCC’s new South Extension Center is opening at 1488 E. Walnut St. in Watseka, adjacent to Riverside Medical Center.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A grand opening celebration will be Wednesday, June 26 from 4:30-7 p.m., with remarks at 5:45 p.m. The public is invited and refreshments will be served.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>KCC’s former Iroquois County Satellite Center has moved from 1001 E. Grant St. in Watseka to the new location, and re-named the KCC South Extension Center.</div>
<div><br />The new location provides expanded access to KCC classes and services in the southern part of the KCC district, with four classrooms, clinical space, a testing area, offices and a student gathering area. KCC is offering college credit, continuing education, GED and adult education classes at the site. In addition to classes at the center, students can register, meet an academic advisor, receive financial aid information, take placement tests, and pick up KCC class schedules and catalogs.</div>
<div><br />“We saw a need to expand the number and type of classes KCC is offering in the Watseka area, and this building was a good complement to our expansion needs,” said Dennis Sorensen, vice president for instructional and student success. “Summer classes begin June 3, and include Microsoft Word, Introductory Speech, Keyboarding, and many others. It’s not too late to register.”</div>
<div><br />The full schedule of summer and fall classes can be viewed online at <a href="/sec">www.kcc.edu/sec/</a>. Fall classes begin the week of Aug. 19.</div>
<div><br />For more information, phone the KCC South Extension Center at 815-432-4670, email <a href="mailto:sec@kcc.edu">sec@kcc.edu</a> or phone KCC’s main campus at 815-802-8500.<br /></div>
