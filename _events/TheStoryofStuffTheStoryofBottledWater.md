<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass633C9EA6D4E84B86969C6111018E6C04"><p>​This Sustainability Week event, &quot;The Story of Stuff/The Story of Bottled Water&quot; will be a &quot;Lunch and Learn&quot; event where you can bring your lunch and enjoy the films which begin at 12 p.m. Tuesday, April 21 in the Iroquois Room, (Room D152).</p>
<p><strong>Event description: </strong>(From the movie's website) <em><a href="http://storyofstuff.org/movies/story-of-stuff/"><em>The Story of Stuff</em></a> &quot;</em>is a 20-minute, fast-paced, fact-filled look at the underside of our production and consumption patterns. <em>The Story of Stuff</em> exposes the connections between a huge number of environmental and social issues, and calls us together to create a more sustainable and just world. It’ll teach you something, it’ll make you laugh, and it just may change the way you look at all the &quot;stuff&quot; in your life forever.”</p>
<p><br />(From the movie's website) <a href="http://storyofstuff.org/movies/story-of-bottled-water/"><em>The Story of Bottled Water</em></a> &quot;tells the story of manufactured demand—how you get Americans to buy more than half a billion bottles of water every week when it already flows virtually free from the tap. Over five minutes, the film explores the bottled water industry’s attacks on tap water and its use of seductive, environmental-themed advertising to cover up the mountains of plastic waste it produces. The film concludes with a call for viewers to make a personal commitment to avoid bottled water and support public investment in clean, available tap water for all.&quot;</p>
<p>This is one of a number of FREE Sustainability Week events being offered at KCC from April 20 to 24. <br /><br />***<br /><a href="/update">Go to Online Update</a><br /><br /><br /><br /></p></div></div>
