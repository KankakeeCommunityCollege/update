<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass5344057698C74AA5833656CDDC3BC5E8"><p>It’s time to gather together in grand tradition of an all-employee (faculty &amp; staff, full- &amp; part-time, student workers) holiday party beginning at 12:15 p.m. on Tuesday, Dec. 22 in the College Center.<img alt="buffett.jpg" src="/FacultyStaff/update/Documents/buffett.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" /></p>
<p>All areas of the college will cease operations at noon on Dec. 22. This will allow employees to gather for the entire celebration. Following the luncheon and party, all employees are invited to use the remaining afternoon hours to take down holiday decorations and prepare for the new year before adjourning for winter break. </p>
<p>Here are the details:</p>
<ul><li>Bring your favorite covered dish to the Cavalier Room before noon. We ask that everyone who eats lunch brings a dish to share so there can be enough food for everyone.</li>
<li>The meat, plates, napkins, plastic ware, bread and condiments will be provided.</li>
<li>Bring a drink, too; beverages will not be provided.</li>
<li>The room will be cleaned at 3 p.m., so please pick up your dishes by then.</li></ul>
<p>In response to employee feedback, we will be eating in the College Center to accommodate more people.</p>
<p>There’s no need to line up early. Rather than having a food line, employees should sit at numbered tables in the College Center. At 12:10 p.m., random drawings will determine when people seated at the tables go through the line. Everyone will have an equal chance to be at the front of the line. Food tables will be set up with selections on both sides to speed up the line.</p>
<p>Although there will not be any contests this year, please feel free to wear your Holiday Sweaters (ugly or not) and your Christmas socks.  The luncheon will conclude with closing comments from Dr. Avendano.<br /></p></div></div>
