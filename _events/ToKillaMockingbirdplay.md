<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClassCACB683D359C479DA4014EB06816BD6D"><p>​The community is invited to a free performance of “To Kill A Mockingbird,” one of America’s most enduring tales of racial injustice in a small southern town.<br /><br /><img alt="To Kill a Mockingbird Atticus and Tom" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Mockingbird_Atticus_and_Tom.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:left;margin:5px" />The play, based on Harper Lee’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, will be presented at Kankakee Community College on Thursday, March 19 at 12:15 p.m. in the Auditorium. It will be approximately two hours long, and includes a post-show discussion. The event is free and open to the public.<br />In this play, as in the book, a sleepy, southern town confronts difference and justice through the eyes of 6-year old Scout. In the heroics of her father, the struggles of her friends and neighbors, and the threat of a boogeyman, Scout lives through the joys of childhood innocence and the pains of growing up.<br /><br />“To Kill A Mockingbird looks squarely in the face of racial hatred and injustice, and for that reason alone, it is incredibly relevant,” said Jason King Jones, artistic director of National Players, the performing troupe. “Encountering some of Harper Lee’s characters may be incredibly difficult—not because they seem so foreign, but because, 80 years later, they feel so familiar.”<br /><img alt="To Kill a Mockingbird cast" src="/FacultyStaff/update/PublishingImages/Mockingbird_cast.jpg" style="vertical-align:auto;float:right;margin:5px" /><br />The 10-member cast of diverse young professional performers from National Players will travel to Kankakee from just outside Washington, D.C. in Maryland.  Founded in 1949, National Players is America's longest-running touring company, and “KCC is delighted to have these Players with their exceptional energy and professional clarity return to our community,” offers Professor Penelope Stickney.</p>
