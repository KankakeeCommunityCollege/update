<p class=MsoNormal style="margin:0in 0in 0pt"><span style="font-size:10pt;color:black;font-family:'Arial','sans-serif'">    Teams are forming for two family Trivia Challenge nights at KCC, 6 to 9:30 p.m. on Friday nights, Jan. 28 and April 1.<br>    Teams can have a maximum of six members. The cost is $10 per person each night or $50 for a team of six each night.<br>    At the Trivia Challenge, a family-friendly atmosphere will offer teams chances to win cash prizes and earn the title of champion. The competition includes 10 rounds of trivia. Teams do not have to be from the same family, although kid-friendly questions will be included in each round.<br>    The event is hosted by the KCC chapter of Lambda Epsilon Chi, a national honor society in paralegal studies. Proceeds will benefit Prairie State Legal Services, a not-for-profit provider of free civil legal services for low-income and elderly residents of Kankakee and Iroquois counties when they are faced with the loss of safety, access to healthcare, income or shelter.<br>    To register a team, or for more information, phone Prairie State Legal Services at 815-935-2750.</span></p>
