<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><font face=Arial color="#333333">As it celebrates three years of public radio programming in the community, WKCC 91.1 FM is holding its winter on-air membership campaign Dec. 3 to 10. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><font face=Arial color="#333333">WKCC is the only full-service public radio station in the Kankakee area.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><font face=Arial color="#333333">“It costs WKCC $650 dollars a day to broadcast public radio programs,” said Mike Savage, director and general manager. “Listeners who become WKCC members help pay for public radio programs like NPR hourly news, A Prairie Home Companion and Performance Today.” </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><font face=Arial color="#333333">To encourage support, everyone who signs up as a WKCC member will be entered to win in WKCC daily drawings of prizes donated by local businesses. Prizes include:</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><font face=Arial color="#333333">--An NFL football autographed by Devin Hester of the Chicago Bears; <br>--A $100 gift card and an iPod touch from Best Buy; <br>--$400 in furniture from Furnish 1-2-3; <br>--A portable Weber grill from Hicksgas; <br>--An overnight stay at the Holiday Inn, a $50 gift card to Homestead Restaurant, and four movie tickets to the Paramount or Meadowview Theater; <br>--A $100 gas card from Huot Oil; a health food basket from Kankakee Natural Foods; and <br>--A $300 custom jewelry package from Volkmann Jewelers. <br>The goal for the member drive is to have 300 new or renewing members sign up to support public radio, Savage said.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><font face=Arial color="#333333">A basic WKCC annual membership is $40. Student and senior memberships are $20.
