<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClass5D01933555B34B8B9541A88C79A35528"><p>​This Sustainability Week event, &quot;What Plants Talk About&quot; will be a &quot;Lunch and Learn&quot; where you can bring your lunch and enjoy the film from noon - 1 p.m. Wednesday, April 22 in the Iroquois Room (Room D152).</p>
<p><strong>Event description:</strong> (From the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2582790/plotsummary?ref_=tt_ov_pl">IMDB website summary</a>) Hard core science is effortlessly integrated with a light-hearted look at how plants behave, revealing a world where plants are as busy, responsive and complex as we are ... It is a world of pulsing activity, where plants communicate, co-operate, and, sometimes, wage all-out war. Come along ... and discover that plants are a lot less passive and a lot more intelligent than you think!</p>
<p>This is one of a number of FREE Sustainability Week events being offered at KCC from April 20 to 24. <br /><br />***<br /><br /><a href="/update">Go to Online Update</a><br /></p></div>
