<div><br />Nancy Cole, 2013 president of the American Welding Society, will present “Women in Welding and the Steel Construction Industry” along with Katherine “Kate” Cloonen, president of JK Steel Erectors construction company.</div>
<div><br />The event will be 2-3:30 p.m. Wednesday, Nov. 13 at KCC in the Iroquois Room, Room D152. It is free and open to the public. </div>
<div><br />&quot;The presentation will be for those of all ages and education levels,” said John Willard, a district director of the American Welding Society. “It is also appropriate for those considering a career transition.”</div>
<div><br />Cole served three terms as a vice president of the American Welding Society before being elected as its president in January.</div>
<div><br />“There is a dire shortage of skilled workers in the welding industry and I’m looking forward to focusing on changing that in 2013,” Cole said in January. “My goal as president this year is to celebrate women in welding and help fill the need for properly skilled and educated welding professionals.”</div>
<div> </div>
<div></div>
<div>Before forming a welding engineering consulting firm, NCC Engineering, Cole worked for ABB Combustion Engineering, where she developed welding electrodes, fluxes, and flux-cored wires. She also worked for Oak Ridge National Laboratories as a program manager and contract manager. She has been awarded three patents. Cole has both a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in metallurgical engineering.</div>
<div><br />Cloonen is a graduate of Ball State University in Indiana with a bachelor's degree in music education. She also has a master's degree in education from the National College of Education (now National Lewis University) in Chicago. After teaching for 16 years, Cloonen started JK Steel Erectors construction company in 1991. Cloonen also has served as an Illinois representative of the 79th district since being elected in November 2012.</div>
