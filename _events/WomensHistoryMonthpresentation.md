<div><b>KCC Description:</b> <div class="ExternalClassC33126E530DE4C47862558C4BA0C8C91"><p>​Award-winning speaker and acclaimed author Erika Gilchrist will visit Kankakee Community College on Thursday, March 26 for two Women’s History Month presentations.<br /><br />The first presentation, at 12:30 p.m. will be “The Secrets of Being an Unstoppable Woman,” in the KCC KCC Auditorium. Then, “How to Be Successfully Authentic,” will be at 5:30 p.m., also in the KCC Auditorium. Both events are free and open to the public.<br /><br />“Long gone are the days of taking the back seat and hoping someone else sees your value,” Gilchrist said. “The first workshop teaches that humility is an overrated virtue and plunges deep into how to claim your rightful place in the driver’s seat, where you are in charge of the direction of your life.”<br />The second workshop, Gilchrist says, is about breaking the chain of being a chronic people pleaser by walking through life catering to the needs of others while neglecting your own.<br /><br />Gilchrist is a Chicago native and has witnessed firsthand the effects of gang violence, drug abuse and poverty on her community. After being the victim of sexual abuse when she was younger, Gilchrist learned to adapt to change and overcome adversity. Her experiences are the basis of her strong passion for empowering women to overcome barriers. <br /><br />Gilchrist’s books include “The Secrets to Being an Unstoppable Woman” (2010), “Success Guide for the Unstoppable Entrepreneur” (2012), “The Unstoppable Woman's Guide to Emotional Well-Being” (2012), and “How to Write &amp; Publish Your Book Now!!” (2012). In 2007, SkillPath Seminars gave Gilchrist the “Highest Trainer Rating of the Year” for conflict management skills for women. She also is a certified life coach by the Professional Woman Network.<br /><br />For more information, contact Laura Gardner at 815-802-8628 or <a href="mailto:lgardner@kcc.edu">lgardner@kcc.edu</a>.<br /><br />***</p>
